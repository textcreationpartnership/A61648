            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>PRopriety in Enjoyments adds a great Excellency to them, unto us; and the more the better they be in themſelves. Jeſus Chriſt is the beſt of Enjoyments; he is the gift of God; ſuch, as he cannot vouchſafe a greater; an unſpeakable gift, and therefore Intereſt in him is the beſt Intereſt. To obtain that, to have God and Chriſt ours, is to have the great, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal bleſſing of the New Covenant ours: grounded aſſurance thereof, is not
<pb facs="tcp:105607:3"/>unfitly called by ſome, a Heaven upon Earth, and to promote this having two heavens, is the deſign of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe; of which, that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and faithful Miniſter of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Owen Stockton,</hi> is the Author. The firſt part being directed to your ſelf, entituled <hi>[Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in Life and Death]</hi> I ſhould offer an injury and not teſtifie my due Reſpects, if I ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this ſecond and principal part alſo to you, Entituled <hi>[The Beſt Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.]</hi> I here preſent it, and doubt not but both will find favourable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation with you.</p>
            <p>If the Lord hath indulged clear Evidences of his Love, and of your own Intereſt in Chriſt, yet you will be glad to have this Confirmation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and that others, even every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb facs="tcp:105607:3"/>may have ſuch a knowledge of it, as to be able groundedly to ſay, <hi>My Beloved is mine and I am his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know, how diſconſolate many real Chriſtians are, and how mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully they walk every day, under their unbelieving Doubtings and Queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings concerning it; they are afraid to draw up that Concluſion; and hereby they are greatly obſtructed in their Duty towards God, (which is not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred but promoted by a clear ſight of propriety in him) Pſal. <hi>63.1. O God thou art [my God]</hi> what then? <hi>early will I ſeek thee.</hi> The moſt ardent ſeekings and thirſtings after God, iſſue and ſpring from a Soul's being able to ſay <hi>[my God.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some in this particular, are too like Scepticks (though in other matters they are not) alwayes doubting and
<pb facs="tcp:105607:4"/>complaining of their own Conditions: ever enquiring, how they may know their own eſtate, and never determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not duly. Thoſe that ſit in ſuch thick darkneſs, that they can ſee no light, they are concerned, to truſt in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Iſa. 50.10. i. e.</hi> to truſt in him, as <hi>the Lord God Gracious and Merciful, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> Exod. <hi>34.5, 6, 7,</hi> when they can draw up no Concluſion that Chriſt is theirs, and they his, and that their ſins are pardoned, yet they are to truſt in that Name, that he may be theirs, and that their ſins may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: thus they may put the great queſtion out of doubt, by ſeeking more to get intereſt, than to know it.</p>
            <p>Others confidently, yet ungroundedly conclude that Chriſt is theirs, without
<pb facs="tcp:105607:4"/>ſeeking a real intereſt in him: all which may be helped here.</p>
            <p>That this Treatiſe may be bleſſed to your ſelf, and to all (under whoſe eye it may come) for its proper end, ſhall be the prayer of,</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105607:6"/>of eminent Piety, yet we Read of him, that when he was under the apprehenſions of Death, he was under Trouble and Sorrow. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.3. <hi>The Sorrows of Death compaſſed me, and the Pains of Hell took hold upon me, I found Trouble and Sorrow.</hi> And as he met with Sorrows, ſo alſo with Horror and Terrors, and that to ſuch a degree, as that he was even overwhelmed thereby. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.4, 5. <hi>My Heart is ſore pained within me, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Death are fallen upon me, Fearfulneſs and Trembling are come upon me, and Horror hath overwhelmed me.</hi>

The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a man that went through abundance of troubles and perſecutions as was ſhewen in part before, and I ſhall now far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew you. He could go to no place, but he expected either to be put in Priſon, or to meet with ſome other affliction. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.23. <hi>The Holy Ghost witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> He was troubled and perſecuted every where, and went in continual danger of his Life. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9, 11. <hi>We are troubled on every ſide—we are perplexed—perſecuted—caſt down but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed— VVe are always delivered unto Death for Jeſus ſake.</hi> Another account of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11, 12.13. <hi>I think that God hath ſet forth us, the Apoſtles laſt, as appointed unto Death; For we are made a ſpectacle to the VVorld, and to Angels, and to Men; we are fools for Chriſts ſake—we are weak—we are deſpiſed— Even unto this preſent hour we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place— we are made as the filth of the VVorld, and are the off ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi> Now although the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> met with abundance of afflictions and perſecutions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105607:11"/>he was exceeding joyful in all his tribulations and as full of comfort as his heart could hold. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am filled with comfort, I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</hi> And whence was it that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuch exceeding joy in all his tribulations? It was in Chriſt, and from Chriſt, as he himſelf tells us. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>VVe rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus. Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>VVe joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> who was the Mother of Chriſt, met with ſore afflictions, which pierced her as if ſhe had a Sword run into her very Soul. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.35. <hi>Yea a ſword ſhall pierce through thine own Soul alſo.</hi> Some underſtand this as a foretelling, that ſhe ſhould ſuffer Death for Chriſt, and be ſlain with the Sword, others underſtood the words Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, that ſhe ſhould be expoſed to ſuch ſharp trials that ſhould pierce her, as if ſhe had a Sword run into her; for reproaches and many other afflictions, are like the piercings of a Sword. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.10. <hi>As with a ſword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me, while they ſay daily unto me, where is thy God.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105607:12"/>my Saviour. David</hi> found great Conſolation in his intereſt in Chriſt, and in God, under all his troubles and ſorrows, of which I might give many inſtances, but ſhall only mention that diſtreſs he was in at <hi>Ziglag.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. <hi>David was greatly diſtreſſed — But David encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Obſerve here the greatneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> diſtreſs; <hi>Ziglag</hi> his City of refuge, was invaded by the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lekites,</hi> ſmitten and burnt with Fire; <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Davids</hi> Wives, and the Wives and Children of the men that were with him were taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and carried away by the enemies. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.3. All their Flocks alſo, and their Herds were carried away in a Triumphing manner, ſaying, <hi>This is Davids ſpoil. ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Davids</hi> diſtreſs was ſo great, <hi>That David and the People that were with him, lift up their voice and wept, till they had no more power to weep. ver.</hi> 4. And which added to his ſorrows was this, that he was now in danger of looſing, and that by the hands of thoſe that had fought for him to ſave his Life, they were ſo enraged againſt <hi>David,</hi> that they ſpake of ſtoning him to Death, and that was an aggravation of his affliction, that beſides his other loſſes, he was now like to looſe his Life, and that in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way, and that by the hand of his Friends. <hi>And David was greatly diſtreſſed for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpake of ſtoning him. ver.</hi> 6. And what was his comfort and encouragement in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs? it was his intereſt in God. <hi>But David
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105607:12"/>encouraged himſelf in the Lord [his God.]</hi> And how doth the Lord become our God? it is in and through Jeſus Chriſt, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes our God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. That we may not only Triumph over all the troubles of this Life, but even over Death it ſelf, by virtue of our intereſt in Chriſt, is evident from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O Death where is thy ſting, O Grave where is thy victory? the ſting of Death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law, but thuaks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He ſpeaks in a Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, as having no dread of Death, but having overcome the fear of Death, and the Grave; <hi>O Death where is thy ſting, O Grave where is thy victory?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, we are not afraid of thee, O Death, or thee, O Grave: thou haſt loſt thy ſting, O Death, and thy victory O Grave. And what is the ground of this Triumph over Death, how came we by this victory? this Triumph is grounded upon an intereſt in Chriſt, this victory is given us of God, through Chriſt, as he is made ours; <hi>Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                     <head>Motives to examine our ſelves, whether we have a ſaving intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>If it be ſo, that intereſt in Chriſt is a ground of ſtrong Conſolation, under all the troubles of this Life, and againſt the fears and terrors of Death, then let us examine our ſelves, whether we have a ſaving intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt? whether we have an actual right to, and a propriety in Chriſt and his ſaving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? can we ſay that Chriſt is ours, and that we are his, and can we ſay this upon good grounds? Have we Evidences, ſatisfactory, and ſure evidences out of Gods word, that Chriſt is ours and we are his? I ſhall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome motives to ſtir us up to examine our ſelves about our intereſt in Chriſt. And then mention ſome ſure evidences of a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, by which we may examine and prove our ſelves, whether we have a real ſaving intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All men have not a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt. Some men are Chriſts. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Ye are Christs.</hi> and Chriſt is theirs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Thomas ſaid unto him, my Lord and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105607:14"/>my God.</hi> But ſome men are none of Chriſts, and Chriſt is none of theirs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> There are multitudes that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hearing of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that have not the Spirit of Chriſt; and whoſoever he be, that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his. Some men have a part in Chriſt, ſome have no part in him, or with him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Jeſus anſwered him, if I waſh thee not thou haſt no part with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Such as make a profeſſion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, but are Hypocrits, and have not ſound and ſincere hearts in the ſight of God, they have no part nor portion in Jeſus Chriſt or his ſaving benefits. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God.</hi> Now there are multitudes that profeſs themſelves to be the Diſciples of Chriſt, and are Baptized as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi> was, whoſe hearts are not right in the ſight of God, and ſo have no part in Chriſt, and therefore we had need examine whether it be not ſo with us. It is a reproach in the Chriſtian World, not to own Chriſt, and therefore to take away the occaſion of reproach, many are content to give their names to Chriſt, that deny him their hearts: Many are deſirous to be called Chriſtians, that will not walk in the ways of Chriſt. Like thoſe women ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.1. <hi>We will eat our own Bread, and wear our own Apparel,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105607:14"/>only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.</hi> So there are many that deſire to be called Chriſtians to take away their reproach, but they will walk in the way of their own hearts, and follow their own wills, and will not walk in the ways of God, and fulfill the will of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A man may have recieved great gifts from Chriſt, and do many great things in the name of Chriſt, he may propheſie in the name of Chriſt, be able to caſt out Divels, and do ſuch works as may cauſe thoſe, that behold them, to wonder at them, and yet not have a ſaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt. He may be one that Chriſt doth not, will not own for one of his. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. <hi>Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name? and in thy name caſt out devils? and in thy name done many wonderfull works? and then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you, depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</hi> Here are great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, fair plea's, and there are many that will expect to be owned by Chriſt, having ſo much to ſay for themſelves, yet Chriſt will ſay unto them, I never knew you, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver owned you for mine, I never approved you, I do not, nor ever did own you for mine.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is nothing in this World of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and greater concernment to every one of us, than to get an intereſt in Chriſt, and to get the knowledge and aſſurance, that we have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt. Our Eternal Life dependeth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105607:15"/>upon our having or not having Jeſus Chriſt. If we have Chriſt we ſhall moſt certainly have Eternal Life; but if we have not Chriſt, all that he or we ever did or ſuffered, will avail us nothing, we ſhall not have Eternal Life. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath Life, but he that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life.</hi> There is nothing of higher concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to get Eternal Life, and this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only in Chriſt, and through an intereſt in him. He, and he only that hath the Son, hath Life. And as the getting an intereſt in Chriſt, is of the higheſt concernment in order to our Eternal Welfare, ſo the knowledge of our intereſt in Chriſt, is of ſingular advantage for our comfort, and well-being in this World. This was a great comfort to <hi>Job</hi> in his great afflictions, to know that Chriſt was his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and that he ſhould after Death and the Reſurrection from the dead, live with him for ever. <hi>Job</hi> 19.23. <hi>I know that my Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er liveth.</hi> To know our intereſt in Chriſt and in God, through Chriſt is a ground of the higheſt joy, and of everlaſting joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.1, 26. <hi>I will ſing of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Lord for ever; He ſhall cry unto me, thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my Salvation.</hi> Sing is an expreſſion of the higheſt joy, when a man can't contain his joy within his heart, but it breaks forth into ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.14. <hi>Behold my Servants ſhall ſing for joy of heart.</hi> Now among thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105607:15"/>which cauſed him to ſing for joy, and for which he was ſo filled with joy, that he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſing for evermore, this was a choice one, the clearing of his intereſt in Chriſt, and in God through Chriſt, that he was enabled to cry, <hi>Thou art my Father, my God, and the rock of my Salvation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. We may attain to ſure and ſatisfying evidences of our intereſt in Chriſt. We may attain to this knowledge that Chriſt is ours, and we are his. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.16. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> It is not ſpoken by way of deſire, Oh that my Beloved were mine, and I were his, nor by way of probability, it may be, I have ſome hope that he is mine, and I am his, but by way of Confidence, <hi>my Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> could with much confidence appeal unto the Lord that he was his. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. <hi>I am thine, ſave me.</hi> So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.5. <hi>We know we are in him.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19.20. <hi>We know that we are of God— We are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Examining our ſelves by thoſe Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are given in the Scriptures, concerning ſuch as have an intereſt in Chriſt, is the ready way to come to the knowledge of our intereſt in Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates.</hi> The Apoſtle here p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts a queſtion; Know ye not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105607:16"/>your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you? And gives them direction how they ſhould attain this knowledge, namely by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining themſelves, and tells what they ſhould examine themſelves about, namely about their Faith, becauſe Faith is one evidence of an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt. And it is obſervable when he puts this queſtion; know ye not how Jeſus Chriſt is in you, yea he addeth, except ye be Reprobates, that is, except ye be blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, they are juſtly blameable that neglect the making ſure ſuch a weighty point as this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be in them or not. They that have Faith in their hearts, have Chriſt dwelling in their hearts. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. Our Souls when enlightned by the word and Spirit of God, are able to diſcern, and to give a judgment of our eſtate towards God, and of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward workings both of Sin and Grace. <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.27. <hi>The Spirit of a man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the Belly.</hi> By the inward parts of the Belly, we may undeſtand all the ſecrets of the heart, the inclinations, diſpoſitions, and motions of the heart both to good and evil. Theſe are all ſearched out, and diſcovered by the Spirit of a man, which is as the Candle of the Lord; but to effect this ſearching of our inward parts, this Candle of the Lord, muſt be lighted by the Word, and the Spirit of the Lord: for till that be done, it gives ſuch a dim and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain light, that we can diſcern but little of our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105607:16"/>own ſtate. Therefore beſides Communing with our own hearts, and making uſe of our own Spirits, we muſt make uſe of the Word of God, that we may diſcern the ſtate of our own Souls towards God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is light. Pſal.</hi> 119.130. <hi>The entrance of thy words giveth light, it giveth underſtanding to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. ver.</hi> 105. <hi>Thy word is a Lamp to my feet, and a light to my path.</hi> There are plain and clear Characters laid down in the Scriptures, of ſuch as are Chriſts, the knowledge of theſe (which I ſhall mention in the next Section) are requiſite for us to examine our ſelves by. And beſides making uſe of our own Spirits, and having recourſe to the light of Gods word, it is needful that we ſhould implore the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his enlightning our minds that gives us light. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>In thy light, ſhall we ſee light. Job.</hi> 32.8. <hi>But there is a Spirit in man, and the inſpiration of the Almighty giveth them underſtanding</hi> The eyes of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are ſhut, till the Spirit of God doth open them. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. And as we need the Spirit to enlighten our underſtandings, ſo alſo to witneſs to and with our Spirits, or being the Children of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spirits, that we are the Children of God</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. They that are effectually called are Chriſts, and Chriſt with all his benefits are theirs. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Ye ſee your calling Brethren— ye are Chriſts.</hi> Whom doth the Apoſtle mean,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105607:17"/>when he ſaith, ye are Chriſts? he meaneth ſuch as are effectually called. And ſpeaking of thoſe that were called, he tells them that God had united them to Chriſt, and made them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the benefits of Chriſt Jeſus. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 30. <hi>Ye ſee your calling Brethren— Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> Eternal Life, and all other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits of Chriſt are promiſed, to them that are effectually called. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of Death for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the Tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Covenant, they which were called might recieve the promiſe of the eternal inheritance.</hi> But Eternal Life, and the ſaving benefits of Chriſt are given only to ſuch as have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God hath not Life.</hi> Now we may know that we are effectually called, theſe ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

God calls a man to ſee, and to know that remiſſion of ſins and Salvation, is to be had in Chriſt, and no where elſe, but in and from Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38. <hi>Through this man is preached unto you remiſſion of ſins. Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</hi> There is Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for loſt man to be had in Chriſt, and in none but him. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is their Salvation in any other, for there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> As the Lord gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that we have deſtroyed and undone our ſelves, ſo alſo he cauſeth us to know that there is help for ſuch as are in a periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and alſo where this help is to be found, namely in himſelf through Chriſt. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O If del thou haſt deſtroved thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> Thus is a material branch of ſaving illumination, the giving as the knowledge of God and Chriſt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.</item>

For after a man is enlightned to ſee his loſt eſtate, then he is at a loſs to know what he ſhould do to be ſaved, and the Lord ſhews him that Salvation is obtained by Chriſt, through Faith and Repentance. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30, 31. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?

                     <p n="2">2. When the Lord calls a ſinner effectually, he calls him to Repentance by working Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in his heart. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.32. <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners unto Repentance.</hi> Now this effectual call to Repentance is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned theſe ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Lord pricks the Sinner at the heart, by ſetting home upon the Conſcience the ſight of his ſinful and undone condition. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>And when they heard theſe things, they were pricked at the heart and ſaid—Men and Brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Till God calls a man, he lyeth faſt aſleep in his ſins. He is like <hi>Jonah,</hi> that was faſt aſleep in the ſide of the Ship, when there was a great Tempeſt, whereby himſelf, and all in the Ship were in danger to be drowned. <hi>Jon.</hi> 1.6. So the ſinner lyeth faſt aſleep in his ſins, although he be in danger of everlaſting burnings, till God awakens him, by calling him to a ſight of his ſin and miſery. As it was with <hi>Peter,</hi> he was faſt aſleep, when bound with Chains, and in the midſt of two Souldiers, and was the next day to be tryed for his Life. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.6. So it is with many Sinners, they are bound in the chains of their ſins, and are in danger every day to be called to Judgment, yet they lye faſt aſleep in their ſins, till the Lord comes and awakens them out of their dead ſleep, and this he doth by giving them a prick at the heart with his word, which is called the Sword of the Spirit. And when a ſinner is pricked at the heart, then he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105607:19"/>awakes out of his dead ſleep, and ſits down, and bemoans his ſinful and miſerable condition. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.16.17. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our head, wo unto us that we have ſinned; for this our heart is faint, and our eyes are dim. Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">(2.) When God calls a ſinner to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he turns his heart from his Idols, from his beloved ſins, ſo that he reſolves in his heart that by the help of Gods grace he will for ſake his ſins for ever. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14 8. <hi>Ephraim ſhall ſay, what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> He is willing to leave off all known ſins, and alſo all unknown ſins, as ſoon as they ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him. <hi>Job</hi> 34.32. <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity I will do no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">(3.) When the Lord calls a ſinner to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as he cauſeth him to forſake his ſins, ſo alſo he cauſeth him to turn to the Lord with his whole heart, ſo that the bent of the heart is for God, the heart is inclined to pleaſe, ſerve, obey, glorifie and enjoy God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. <hi>They ſhall return to me with their whole heart. Pſal.</hi> 119.112. <hi>I have enclined my heart to perform thy ſtatutes always, even to the end.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When God calleth a ſinner effectually, he calleth him to his Son Jeſus Chriſt. As he enlightneth him to ſee his undone eſtate out of Chriſt, and to ſee that Salvation is to be had in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105607:20"/>Chriſt, ſo he draweth the Soul to Chriſt, he cauſeth the Soul to come to Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>Every man that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> The call of God when it is effectual, hath this effect upon all that are called, it bringeth every one of them to Jeſus Chriſt. It is not ſome or many that hear, but every man that hath heard and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father cometh unto me. Now we may diſcern that God hath called us to Chriſt theſe ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If he hath called us off from all things that hinder our going to Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Riſe up my love, my fair one, and come away,</hi> Come away that is let nothing detain thee from coming to me, caſt away all lets and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances that keep thee from coming to me, leave all to follow me. This effect <hi>Levi</hi>'s call had upon him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.27, 28. <hi>He ſaid unto him follow me; and he left all, roſe up and followed him.</hi> When God hath brought us to this, that we are willing to leave all for Chriſt, we need not doubt but we are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called to Chriſt. This laying aſide of all hinderances of our being made partakers of Chriſt and Eternal Life, is that which the Apoſtle exhorts to. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight— And run with pationce the race that is ſet before us.</hi> I will inſtance in ſome hinderances of our enjoying Chriſt, which God calls from, when he draws us to Chriſt. As the VVorld, the profits of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105607:20"/>world, the honours of the world, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, God looſens the heart from all theſe, that the Soul can leave all the goodly, all the pleaſant, all the glorious things of the world, to cleave to Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Come with me from Lebanon my Spouſe, with me from Lebanon.</hi> For the opening this Scripture, let us conſider what Lebanon was, that Chriſt was ſo earneſt with his Spouſe, to come with him from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that he calleth twice, come with me from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> with me from <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Lebanon</hi> was a very goodly place. <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.25. <hi>I pray let me go over and ſee the good Land, that is, beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. Moſes</hi> had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was the Land of promiſe, a land above all lands, and of all places in that land, he had a deſire to ſee that goodly place mount <hi>Lebanon; Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon</hi> was a glorious place. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.2. <hi>The glory of Lebanon ſhall be given to it. Lebanon</hi> was a very pleaſant and delightfull place, it caſt forth a ſweet ſeent to all places round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.6. <hi>His be my ſhall be as the Olive Tree, and his ſmall as Lebanon.</hi> The meaning then is this, that we ſhould leave all the goodly, all the glorious, all the pleaſant, all the delightfull and deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>able things of this world to enjoy Chriſt. Chriſt calls us to come with him from <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was a goodly, a deſireable, a glorious and delightfull place. Another hinderance of coming to Chriſt is,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105607:21"/>when a man is bound with the cords of his ſins, his ſins have ſuch hold upon his heart, that he is like a man bound with cords, that he can't ſtir from them; of ſuch <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.22. <hi>He ſhall be holden with the cords of his ſins.</hi> And this was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.23. <hi>I percieve that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now when God calls a ſinner to Chriſt, he looſeth theſe bonds, ſo that ſuch an one can ſay with <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 116.16. <hi>Thou haſt looſed my bonds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. VVhen God calleth a man to Chriſt he cauſeth the ſoul to follow hardafter Chriſt, to be both earneſt and ſpeedy in running after Chriſt. Pſal. 63.8. <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee.</hi> This following hard after Chriſt implyeth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires and endeavours to enjoy him, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to be without him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Running after Chriſt implyeth earneſtneſs and ſpeed in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt, and unweariedneſs in ſeeking after Chriſt, <hi>Iſa</hi> 40.31. <hi>They ſhall run and not be weary.</hi> Is thy ſoul earneſt? is thy ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in following after Chriſt? then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Lord hath drawn thee by his Spirit. For no man goeth thus after Chriſt, till the Lord hath drawn him, <hi>Joh</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. VVe may know that God hath called and drawn us to Chriſt, if we follow after Chriſt under all the difficulties and diſcouragements,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105607:21"/>that we meet with in the wayes of Chriſt. VVhen God calls us to Chriſt effectually, he carries us through all difficulties and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, ſo that nothing ſhall hinder us from following Chriſt. He makes good that wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Every valley ſhall be filled, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mountain ſhall be brought low, and the crooked ſhall be made ſtreight, and the rough wayes ſhall be made plain.</hi> It is an alluſion to the Jewes coming out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which journey they met with many difficulties, they went through low valleyes which oft-times are filled with ter, they went over high hills and great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, they went through crooked and rough wayes; But God put ſuch a ſpirit into them, that they went on with that courage and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs, as is if every valley had been filled, and every hill and mountain brought low, and all crooked places had been made ſtraight, and rough places plain. So it is in effectual calling, God carryeth on the ſoul ſo powerfully after Chriſt, that it is carryed through all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all difficulties and diſcouragements to come to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.29. <hi>By thee, I have run through a troop, by my God, I have leaped over a wall.</hi> As it was with the blind man that cryed after Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.48. <hi>Many charged him that he ſhould hold his peace, but he cryed the more a great deal. Thou ſon of David have mercy on me.</hi> So it is with thoſe that feel their want of Chriſt, and are called to Chriſt, when carnal people, and carnal relations would beat them off from the wayes of Chriſt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105607:22"/>they are the more earneſt to follow after. VVe read of <hi>Saul,</hi> that when the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed him, <hi>There went with him a band of men whoſe hearts God had touched,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.26, 27. If we go after Chriſt, when he is deſpiſed by the world, it is a ſign that God hath touched our hearts, and drawn us to his Son.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When God calls a ſinner to come to Chriſt, he cannot be ſatisfied with any thing beſides Chriſt. He takes him from reſting in any thing ſhort of Chriſt. After we are awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee our ſin and miſery, there are many things wherein we would reſt ſhort of Chriſt, if God ſhould let us alone. As for inſtance, we are apt to reſt in our priviledges as the Jews, who cryed out, <hi>the temple of the Lord, we have Abraham to our Father, &amp;c.</hi> And we are prone to reſt in Ordinances, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Duties, in our convictions, humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, affections, reformations, and the like, but he takes us off from reſting in any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Chriſt</hi> when he calls us unto Chriſt. What <hi>Michah</hi> ſaid unto the Jews, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Ariſe ye and depart, this is not your reſt.</hi> So the Lord ſaith to ſuch as he calls effectually, when they are taking up their reſt in any thing ſhort of Chriſt, he calls them off from thoſe reſts &amp; ſaith. Ariſe and come unto my ſon, for this is not your reſt. A ſoul effectually called is like the dove that went out of the Ark while the waters covered the earth, ſhe found no reſt for the ſole of her foot, till ſhe returned into the Ark, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9. So the ſoul effectually called can find no reſt any where
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105607:22"/>but in Chriſt. <hi>Mary Magdelen</hi> had ſeen wonders in the ſtone rolled from the Sepulchre, the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen clothes in which the body of Chriſt was wrapped, ſhe had a viſion of Angels, but the ſight of the Angels did not ſatisfie her, becauſe ſhe could not find Chriſt, but wept for him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.1, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. When God calls a ſinner to come to Chriſt, he taketh up his reſt in Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth on him only, for remiſſion of ſins and eternal life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 62.6. <hi>He onely is my rock and my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and are heavy laden, and I will give you</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. When God calleth a ſinner effectually, he called him unto holineſs, 1 <hi>The.</hi> 4.7. <hi>God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs.</hi> Now we may know our effectual call unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs theſe wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By our earneſt deſires and endeavours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter holineſs. This call of God begets earneſt deſires after holineſs, a hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, ſuch an one hath, oh that I were more holy, oh that I could ſerve and obey God in a better manner, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5. <hi>Oh that my wayes were directed to keep thy ſtatutes, ver.</hi> 20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing that it hath to thy judgements at all times.</hi> And this call doth produce ſtrong deſires, ſo alſo earneſt endeavors after holineſs, ſo that a man makes his care, and continual exerciſe to live an holy life, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>And herein do I exerciſe my ſelf to have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105607:23"/>alwayes a conſcience voyd of offence both towards God and towards men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. This call to holineſs leaves ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiion upon the heart, that if through temptation he fall into ſin, and depart from the wayes of God, he can have no reſt in his ſpirit, until he is riſen up again, and hath hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his ſoul before God, and be returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.16. <hi>A juſt man falleth ſeven times and riſeth again.</hi> A juſt man may fall, yea fall often, but he is not to reſt in his ſins; but maketh haſt to riſe up again. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of unregenerate men to lye in their ſins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>The whole world lyeth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> They that are called out of the world may fall into ſin by temptation, but they do not lye in their ſins, they make haſt to riſe up again. A ſheep may fall into the mire, but makes haſt to get out. They are ſwine that love to wallow in the mire.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We may know that we are effectually called unto holineſs when we adhere to the wayes of God in difficult and troubleſom times, when no perſecutions, no troubles will make us forſake the wayes of God, and turn aſide to crooked paths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us,</hi> (that is all the forementioned troubles) <hi>yet we have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee, nor dealt falſely in thy Covenant. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps declined from thy way,</hi> Pſal. 119.109, 110. <hi>My ſoul is continually in my hands, yet do I not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105607:23"/>thy Law. The wicked have laid a ſnare for me, yet I erred not from thy Precepts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. When God calls a man to Holineſs, he enclines his heart to be holy, not only in ſome but in all things; Holy in Body and in Spirit, Holy in his Diſcourſe, and Holy in all manner of Converſation. They that are Effectually called unto Holineſs, are like the Unmarried VVoman, ſpoken of by the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.34. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmarried Woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be Holy both in Body and in Spirit.</hi> This is the care of Gods called ones, they care for the things of the Lord, that they may be Holy in Body and in Spirit. They are alſo careful to be Holy in their Diſcourſe, remembring that Exhortation of the Apoſtle. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Let no corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good, to the uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter Grace unto the Hearers.</hi> They are alſo carefull to be Holy in all manner of Converſation. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>But as he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. VVhen God calls a ſinner Effectually, he calls him to lay hold of Eternal Life, he calls him unto the participation of his Heavenly and Glorious Kingdom. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The God of all Grace who hath called us into his Eternal Glory by Ieſus Christ.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That ye walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105607:24"/>
                        <hi>Whereunto he called you by our Goſpel, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Lay hold on Eternal Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto thou art called.</hi> As it was with the carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> they deſpiſed the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though it was a moſt pleaſant and delightfull Land, and would rather have enjoyed the Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> than to go through diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan. Pſal.</hi> 106.24. <hi>Yea, they deſpiſed the pleaſant Land.</hi> So it is with carnal Chriſtians, before God calls them Effectually, they deſpiſe, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect Eternal Life, they prefer this tranſitory vain VVorld, before the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> deſpiſed his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſold it for a Morſel of Meat, ſo do prophane men deſpiſe the means of Grace and Salvation, and part with the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for as inconſiderable things as a Morſel of Meat. But when God calls a man effectually, then Heaven and Heavenly things are the chief things he ſeeks after. Now we may know, whether God hath called us to lay hold on eternal life, theſe ways.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. VVhen God calls a man to obtain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and Salvation, he gives hm the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and belief of the truth, reality and tranſcendant excellency of the Kingdom of Heaven, that it infinitely ſurpaſſeth all the good things of this vain and tranſitory world. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>We know that if our earthly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105607:24"/>of God, an houſe, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> And as the truth of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom is believed, ſo it is eſteemed, and preferred above all things in this World. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. <hi>But now they deſire a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that is, an Heavenly.</hi> This World is a miſerable world, but Heaven is looked upon as a moſt bleſſed and glorious place, by thoſe that are Effectually called. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of the great God, and our Saviour.</hi> In Heaven they expect ſuch things as eye never ſaw, the ear never heard, and better and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er things, than the heart of man can concieve, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When God calls a ſinner to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt, he ſtirs up in his heart an earneſt deſire after Salvation, and cauſeth him to make it his great care and main buſineſs to get to Heaven. The great enquiry of ſuch an one is, what he ſhould do to be ſaved, and how he may get eternal life? <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved? Matth.</hi> 19.16. <hi>And behold one came unto him and ſaid, good maſter, what good thing ſhall I do that I may have Eternal Life.</hi> And they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire diligently after the way to life, ſo they make it their main and chief care to get to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, according to that command of Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>But ſeek ye firſt, the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs</hi> — And that of the Apoſtle; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Work out your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105607:25"/>with Fear and Trembling.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When God calls a man to obtain Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he diſcovers to him the way to Life and Salvation; and bows his heart to walk in the path of life. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of Life.</hi> He ſheweth them that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Salvation is to be had in Chriſt, and no where elſe but in Chriſt. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. And this is the record that God hath given to us, Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other name given under Heaven, whereby men may be ſaved.</hi> And he ſheweth them, that they that would have Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, muſt believe in him, and obey him, and perſevere in the Faith of Chriſt, and in their obedience of the Goſpel to the end of their lives. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>And being made perfect he became the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him. Rev.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. When God calls a man to obtain Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt, he leaveth ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the glory and excellency of the Kingdom of Heaven, that he preſſeth more earneſtly after the Kingdom of Heaven, than he doth after any thing in this world. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13.14. <hi>This one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things that are behind, and reaching forth unto
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105607:25"/>thoſe things that are before, I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> It was the main thing the Apoſtle aimed at, ſtrove, and contended for, preſſed after the obtaining the Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and being found in that way that leadeth to life. No oppoſitions from the world can beat off one effectually called, from ſeeking eternal life, but he uſes an holy violence, and doth as it were take it by force, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. <hi>From the dayes of John the Baptiſt until now the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. They that are effectually called will go through any ſufferings to obtain the Kingdom of God. We are told in Gods word, <hi>that we muſt, through much tribulation, enter into the Kingdom of God, Act.</hi> 14.22. But this doth not diſmay thoſe that are called to obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They make light of the ſufferings of this life, in compariſon of the glory, and the felicity of the future life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

As it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when God called them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were willing to go through the Red Sea, and to go into a howling wilderneſs, where were Scorpions and fiery Serpents, to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105607:26"/>get into the land of promiſe. So it is with thoſe that are called out of their natural ſtate, they are willing to go through any troubles and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, though it be a reſiſting unto blood, to get into the Kingdom of Heaven. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Others were tortured, not accepting deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, that they might obtain a better Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> To get the poſſeſſion, and make ſure of this Kingdom, a man Effectually called will readily and joyfully ſuffer the loſs of all things that he hath in this world. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.44.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Recieving Chriſt as he is offered to us in the Goſpel, is an undoubted evidence of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intereſt in Chriſt. Upon our recieving Chriſt he becomes ours, and we become his. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as recieved him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God</hi>— All that recieve Chriſt, how many ſoever they be, have an intereſt in God as their Father, and in Chriſt as their Saviour. Chriſt is the gift of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son— Joh</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God,</hi> that is, if thou kneweſt me who am the gift of God; as the following words ſhew, <hi>and who it is that ſaith to thee, give me to drink.</hi>— Now what is it makes a gift ours, but an offer from him that hath power to beſtow it, and acceptance by him to whom it is offered. God hath power to beſtow Chriſt on whom he pleaſeth, and he maketh an offer of Chriſt unto every one that finds his want of Chriſt, and is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105607:26"/>Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take the water of Life freely.</hi> Upon our accepting Chriſt on that offer, which God makes of him in the Goſpel, Chriſt becomes ours, and we become his; Recieving Chriſt is believing on Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as recieved him— to them that believe on his name.</hi> And as for ſuch as believe in Chriſt, Chriſt is theirs, for he dwelleth in their hearts. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here it may be enquired, how ſhall we know whither we have recieved Jeſus Chriſt in a true and ſaving manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Such as recieve Jeſus Chriſt aright, recieve him in all his offices, they recieve him as their Prophet, as their Prieſt, and as their King. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>As ye have therefore reciev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> Here is mention of the 3 fold office of Chriſt. His Prophetical Office is ſignified by Chriſt, which ſignifieth anointed, he was anointed with the Spirit to Preach the Goſpel. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. Jeſus ſignifieth his Prieſtly Office, for Jeſus ſignifieth a Saviour, and he was called Jeſus, becauſe he was to ſave his People from their ſins. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. And how doth he ſave his People from their ſins, but by his offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for us? Lord ſignifieth his Kingly Office. Theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> recieved Chriſt in all theſe Offices, as their Prophet, as their Prieſt, and as their Lord, they recieve
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105607:27"/>Chriſt Jeſus the Lord. And ſo do all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve Chriſt aright.</p>
                     <p>Now then we recieve Chriſt as our Prophet, when we make the word of Chriſt the rule of our Faith, our Worſhip, and of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The word of Chriſt is the rule of our Faith, what we find in the word of Chriſt, that we are to believe, though it ſeem hard to our underſtandings. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me as the Scripture hath ſaid</hi>— Our Faith muſt be regulated by the Scriptures. And <hi>Abraham</hi> believed according to what God had ſpoken to him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hope againſt hope — according to that which was ſpoken.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4, 11. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our ſins according to the Scriptures, and roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures. — So we preach, and ſo ye believe.</hi> We are to believe all things according as they are held forth in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The word of Chriſt is to be the rule of our worſhip, whatever cenſures or calumnies the world caſt upon us, of Hereſie or Schiſme or the like, yet we muſt keep cloſe to the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. After this way which they call hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets. The Paſſeover was part of the worſhip of God, and the <hi>Jews</hi> are blamed for neglecting and not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105607:27"/>eating the Paſſeover in that ſort and manner as was directed in the written word of God. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.5. <hi>They eſtabliſhed a decree that they ſhould come to keep the Paſſeover unto the Lord God of Iſrael at Jeruſalem, for they had not done it of a long time, in ſuch ſort as was written.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>A multitude of People had not cleanſed themſelves, yet did they eat the Paſſeover, otherwiſe than it was written.</hi> And that they ſinned in eating the Paſſover in other manner than was preſcribed in the written word of God, is evident from the following words, wherein <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayeth for the pardon of their ſin. <hi>The good Lord pardon every one</hi>— Our Lord Jeſus would not go againſt the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word in matters of Worſhip, for the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole world. When the Devil carried him up into an high Mountain, and ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and proffered to give them all to Chriſt, if he would fall down and worſhip him, he rejected the motion with diſdain, becauſe it was againſt the written word, to worſhip any other but the true God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.8, 9, 10. The Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Idols being forbidden in the word of God, the Three Children choſe rather to be caſt into the burning fiery furnace, than to worſhip the golden Image which <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> had ſet up, and commanded all perſons to worſhip, under the greateſt penalty, even preſent Death, and that a dreadful death, to be burnt in a fiery furnace. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.15, 18.

                     <p n="1">1. If we are willing to be ruled and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt.

For Chriſt Rules us by his Word and Spirit. What <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 42.14. <hi>According to thy word ſhall all my People be ruled.</hi> So may I ſay here. They that recieve Chriſt as Lord, they are all Ruled according to his word. Now we may know that we are willing to be Ruled by the word of Chriſt.</p>

For it is not lawful to hate father or mother or brother. He that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a murderer, but hating is leſs loving, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.30, 31. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.13. <hi>He that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to the end ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So that the terms on which Chriſt is willing to become ours, are briefly theſe. That we love and prefer Chriſt above all perſons in the world, even our

That we deny our ſelves, that we are willing to under go all ſufferings for Chriſt, that we forſake all that we have for him, that we follow him, that we continue with him to the end of our dayes. And as we muſt underſtand theſe terms, ſo alſo approve of them, and judge Chriſt and ſalvation by Chriſt worthy of all acceptation in theſe terms, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.

                        <hi>A.</hi> 1.

'Tis as if he ſhould have ſaid, Lord! apply thy Sons Blood to my Soul, and then I ſhall be cleanſed from my ſins. So the Apoſtle when diſtreſſed with the ſenſe of ſin, fetcheth his Conſolation from Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this Death, I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> But the convictions of natural Conſcience either make a man deſperate, as we ſee in <hi>Judas,</hi> who hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, or wear off by diverting to the pleaſures and buſineſſes of the world. <hi>Saul</hi> when under trouble was quieted by Muſick, or elſe Conſcience is eaſed by the doing ſome good works, and doth fetch its eaſe from Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And as the Spirit convinceth thoſe to whom

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105607:39"/>gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance.</hi> Love to God and one another, joy in <hi>Zions</hi> welfare, when it goeth well with the Church and People of God, peaceableneſs whereby a man endeavours to live peaceably with all men, and to make peace among thoſe that are at variance long-ſuffering whereby we bear afflictions patiently, though they belong upon us, and are not eaſily provoked to anger. Gentleneſs whereby we carry our ſelves with mildneſs; not like <hi>Nabal</hi> churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who was ſuch a ſon of <hi>Belial</hi> that no man could tell how to ſpeak to him. Goodneſs, whereby we are ready to do good to all men. Faith, whereby we rely on God, and keep faith with men. Meekneſs, whereby we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſelves humbly, and without fierceneſs towards others. Temperance which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moderation in eating and drinking, theſe are fruits of the Spirit.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>But ſome may ſay, ſeeing Meekneſs and Temperance <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moral virtues which have been found in the Heathen, that have not the Spirit of Chriſt, how ſhall we know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Meekneſs, Temperance, Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are moral virtues or fruits of the Spirit.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. When it is Conſcience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God that puts us upon the exerciſe of Love, Meekneſs, Patience, Temperance, and the like, then our Meekneſs and Patience and Temperance are the fruits of the Spirit.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105607:40"/>For what is wrought in us by the word of God is wrought by the Spirit, the word is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by which ordinarily the Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that we ſhould love one another as he gave us Commandement.</hi> A Chriſtian hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the command of Chriſt in the exerciſe of love.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we have felt in our ſelves the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations to contrary vices, as Frowardneſs, Intemperance, Malice, and the like, and have by Faith in Chriſt and Prayer, obtained victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over thoſe natural inclinations, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meekneſs and Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then are they the fruits of the Spirit. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.11. <hi>Your Heavenly Father will give the holy Spirit to them that ask him. Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body ye ſhall live.</hi> The mortification of any ſin is obtained only by the Spirit. And therefore if we were naturally haſty, but have mortified that haſty Spirit, and got a meek and quiet Spirit, that is from the Spirit of God. And the like may be ſaid of the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If in the exerciſe of Meekneſs, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the like, we have a reſpect to Chriſt, the honour and glory of Chriſt, and not at our own glory, or ſome other ſelfiſh end, then our Meekneſs and Temperance are the fruits of the Spirit. For it is the Spirit that cauſeth us to ſeek the glory of Chriſt, as was ſhewed before. <hi>He ſhall glorifie me.</hi> But
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105607:40"/>where there are onely moral vertues, there is looking no further than ſelf ends, as a mans own glory, or health or the like.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. We may know we have the Spirit of Chriſt by our minding ſpiritual things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>For they that are after the fleſh do mind the things of the fleſh, but they that are after the ſpirit the things of the ſpirit.</hi> The diſpoſition of the mind is a diſcovery of a mans ſtate. If he chiefly mind the profits and pleaſures of the World, or the honours of the World, and what gratifieth corrupt nature, he is a carnal unregenerate man. But if he chiefly mind the things of the Spirit, ſuch as the ſaving his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul, the pleaſing, enjoying and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, if his mind and heart be chiefly carried out after Spiritual Bleſſings, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, that is an argument that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the Spirit of God. And therefore let us make enquiry into the diſpoſition of our minds. Now the diſpoſition of the mind may be known.</p>

For it is an evident ſign that God hath given a man a new heart and a new ſpirit, when there mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his ſins maketh him to loath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 31. <hi>A new heart alſo will I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105607:41"/>give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you —Then ſhall ye remember your own evil wayes and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and for your abominations.</hi> And for confirmation of this, that ſelf loathing, and loathing of our ſins is an evidence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace of God; we may take notice that unregenerate men are full of ſelf love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves.</hi> And they may leave ſome of their ſins, but they do not loath them. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeaking of a graceleſs perſon, ſaith of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.4. <hi>He abhorreth not evil.</hi> If any ask, How ſhall we know whether we loath our ſins, and loath our ſelves for our ſins.</p>
                     <p>I Anſwer, 1. A man that loatheth himſelf for his ſins, looketh upon himſelf as a vile and loathſom creature, and bluſheth and is aſhamed of himſelf, when he cometh into the preſence of God, <hi>Job</hi> 40.4. compared with <hi>Job</hi> 46.6. <hi>Behold I am vile — wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes. Job</hi> who abhorred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, looked upon himſelf as a vile creature, and repented in duſt and aſhes, abaſed himſelf before God, as more vile then the duſt. <hi>Ezra</hi> bluſhed and was aſhamed to lift up his face to God. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>O my God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face unto thee my God, for our iniquities are encreaſed over our head, and our treſpaſs is grown up to the heavens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. When a man loathes his ſins, they are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105607:42"/>burthenſom and troubleſom to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4 <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burden, they are too heavy for me.</hi> He would fain be freed from his ſins. We flee as farr as we can from things, and perſons which we abhorr. <hi>Job.</hi> 30.10. <hi>They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr me, they flee far from me.</hi> A man that loaths his ſins, would not live in his ſins, though he ſhould not be puniſhed for them. As 'tis with a man that loatheth his Life, he would fain be rid of it, he would not live alwaies. <hi>Job</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>My Soul chuſeth ſtrangling and death, rather than Life; I loath it, I would not live alway.</hi> So it is with a man in reſpect of his ſins, his Soul chooſeth the Death rather than the Life of his ſins, and if he might have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to continue in his ſins, without being caſt into Hell for them, yet he would not live always in them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A new creature is an humble creature, one that hath very poor and mean, and low thoughts of himſelf.

Whatever gifts and excellencies God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, whatever ſervices and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he hath gone through, he looks upon himſelf as a poor inconſiderable creature, of no worth or value. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. <hi>In nothing am I behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, though I am nothing.</hi> The Apoſtles had great gifts,

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105607:43"/>of the very leaſt of all Gods mercies. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and all the truth that thou haſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto thy ſervant.</hi> And they look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as worthy of the greateſt of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even to be confounded and deſtroyed for ever. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7. <hi>O Lord!

And ſaveth the humble. <hi>Job</hi> 22.29. <hi>He ſhall ſave the humble perſon.</hi> But God dwelleth with none, he will ſave none but ſuch as are new creatures; For except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He that is a new creature hath a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed judgment, a renewed will, renewed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and a renewed converſation. Grace is like Heaven, which diſſuſeth it ſelf into the whole lump. He hath a renewed judgment, he judgeth ſin to be the greateſt evil, whereas fools make a mock of ſin. And he judgeth the enjoyment of God the chiefeſt good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as carnal perſons make light of God. <hi>Iſrael would none of me. Deut.</hi> 32.15. <hi>He lightly eſteemed the rock of his Salvation</hi> He judgeth all worldly enjoyments to be but vanity, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105607:43"/>heaven to be the beſt riches and choiſeſt porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He hath a renewed will; whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his will was averſe to holineſs, inclined to that which is evil. Now the bent of the will is towards God and againſt ſin, ſo that a man chooſeth the things that pleaſe God, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that which is offenſive to God. He hath renewed affections; whereas his affections were ſet on things below, now they are ſet on things above. He hath a renewed Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and walketh in newneſs of life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He that is a new creature is taken off from his old foundation, and built upon a new foundation. An houſe may have much repairs done it, the Windows may be enlarged, the breaches that were made may be ſtopped up, the walls may be whited over, and yet this doth not make it a new houſe, unleſs there be a new Foundation. It is he the old houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and not a new houſe. So here, a man may reform many things, as <hi>Herod</hi> did, he may have more light in his underſtanding, he may be like the Phariſees, outwardly Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a painted Sepulchre, and yet be no new creature, the old man may lye hid under a form of Godlineſs, he may be dreſſed up in a religious garb, and yet ſuch a man is not a new creature. Now a man is taken of his old Foundation in theſe reſpects.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. He is taken off from expecting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Life, by the old Covenant, or the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105607:44"/>Covenant of works. For he is fully convinced, that by the deeds of the law no fleſh whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be juſtified in the ſight of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight</hi> Now till God takes a man off, till the Lord inſtill renewing grace into a mans heart, he ſeeks for Righteouſneſs and Life by the works of the Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. But when God makes a man a new creature, then he ſeeks after the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and expects Life and Righteouſneſs by promiſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25. and upon terms of free grace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8.

We naturally go about to eſtabliſh our own Righteouſneſs <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. But God takes us off from this, and ſhews us that Chriſt is the Foundation on which we are to build our Faith and Hope. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11.

For an unregenerate man acts from ſelf and for ſelf, ſelf is his Principle he acts from, and ſelf is his rule he walks by, and ſelf is the end he aims at. He ſeeks his own with his

But when God makes a man a new creature, he teacheth him to deny himſelf, and to prefer God above himſelf, he is acted then by new Principles, and hath new ends in his actions.

Now though through Gods mercy I find ſomething of the renewing grace of God, yet I feel ſtill ſome remainders of the old man, I cannot ſay that all old things are paſt away, and that all things are become new, and therefore I am afraid that I am not a new creature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. We muſt diſtinguiſh between a new creature and a perfect creature. We may be new creatures though we be not perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but have imperfections adhering to us. There is no doubt but the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a new creature, yet he confeſſeth of himſelf that he was not perfect. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105607:45"/>though I had already attained, either were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfect. Job</hi> was a new Creature, yet he diſclaimed the ſaying he was perfect, and if he had ſaid it, his impatient ſpeeches under his afflictions would have proved his imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me, if I ſay I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it ſhall prove me perverſe.</hi> Perfection of grace is the priviledge of the Saints in Heaven, not of the Saints on Earth. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23. <hi>Ye are come to the Heavenly Jeruſalem, and to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new, initially in thoſe that are new creatures. God hath begun to renew the whole Soul, and to mortifie all the luſts and members of the old man. Grace though it be but in part, diffuſeth it ſelf into every part of a man, it is like leaven that leaveneth the

And as all things are begun to be made new, ſo they ſhall as certainly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected as if they were already done.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given.</hi> This was ſpoken many hundred years before the Birth of Chriſt, becauſe it was certain that he ſhould be born, it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as already done. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.47. <hi>Verily, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me hath Everlaſting Life.</hi> Eternal Life is enjoyed in Heaven, yet becauſe it is ſure to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, it is not ſaid he ſhall have, but he hath Everlaſting Life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is a relative and a real change in ſuch as are new creatures. By a relative change I underſtand a change of their ſtate and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God. As for inſtance, when a man of an enemy becomes a friend of God. When a man of a child of wrath becomes a child of God. Whereas a man was under the curſe he comes under the bleſſing, whereas a man was in a ſtate of Condemnation, he is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a ſtate of Salvation. In reſpect of this Relative change, all old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new in him, that is a new creature. For he that is in Chriſt is no more under the curſe and wrath of God,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105607:46"/>and in a ſtate of Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life. A real change is the change that is made of the Heart and Life of him that is a new Creature; This change is carryed on gradually.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. There are different degrees of grace in thoſe that are new creatures, ſome are Babes in Chriſt, ſome little Children, ſome young Men, ſome Fathers. Such as are but babes in Chriſt are new Creatures, as well as thoſe that are Fathers, but have more weakneſſes and imperfections than young Men or Fathers. Such as are but babes in Chriſt, have ſuch great imperfections, and are ſo weak in grace, that they are more like to Carnal than Spiritual perſons. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>And I brethren could not ſpeak unto you as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, even as unto babes in Chriſt.</hi> Yet even in ſuch as are but babes in Chriſt, there may be diſcerned ſome workings and ſtirrings of the grace of God, as for inſtance.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. Crucifying the fleſh with the luſts and affections thereof, is a good evidence of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intereſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>And they that are Chriſts have Crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</hi> For the underſtanding of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we muſt enquire what is meant by Fleſh, what by the affections of the fleſh, what by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105607:48"/>the luſts, and what by Crucifying the fleſh with the affections and luſts. By the fleſh is not meant the body, but the corruption of our natures, the works of the fleſh ſpoken of <hi>ver.</hi> 19.20, 21. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Hatred, Variance,</hi> &amp;c. They that are Chriſts Crucifie theſe works of the fleſh. By the affections are meant ſinfull affections, when we ſet our affections on things unlawfull, and when we ſet our affections inordinately on things that are lawfull, all inordinate affections are to be mortified. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are on the earth— inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> As for natural affections when kept in due bounds, they are not to be Crucified, for it is no virtue, but a great degree of degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to be without natural affection. Such as are without natural affection are not reckoned among the Saints, but among the chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Without underſtanding, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant breakers, without natural affection</hi>— By luſts underſtand, the inclinations of the heart unto evil things. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Now theſe are our Examples, to the intent we ſhould not lust af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> Now to Crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts, is to mortifie our corrupt natures, with the works that proceed from it, and not only to mortifie the works of the fleſh, but all inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections, and all luſtings after evil things,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105607:49"/>it is oppoſed to living after the fleſh, which will bring eternal death, and is inconſiſtent with the grace of God, and an intereſt in Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if ye through the Spirit do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> To Crucifie the fleſh with the luſts and affectious, is to dye to ſin, to put all our ſins to Death, a Metaphor taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> putting Chriſt to Death, let us therefore conſider what the <hi>Jews</hi> did to Chriſt when they Crucified him, and ſee whether we have done the like to our ſins, and thereby we ſhall know whether we have Crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the <hi>Jews</hi> Crucified Chriſt, they found him out, and had a token given to them whereby they ſhould know him. <hi>Joh</hi> 18.2. <hi>Judas which betrayed him knew the place. Mat.</hi> 26.48. <hi>Now he that betrayed him, gave them a ſign, ſaying, whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, that ſame is he, hold him faſt.</hi> So they that have Crucified the fleſh with the luſts and affections, have gotten the knowledge of their ſins, they know the plague of their hearts. They can ſay as the <hi>Jews, Iſa.</hi> 58.12. <hi>As for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities we know them.</hi> This is one ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Reformation, to diſcover what is amiſs in our hearts and ways. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>I thought on my ways, and I turned my feet unto thy Teſtimony.</hi> But if a man go no farther than the getting the knowledge of our ſins, and do
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105607:49"/>not forſake them, this will make us the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sinners by ſinning againſt light.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Jews had found out Chriſt, they went with him to <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the high Prieſt, and took counſel againſt Chriſt to put him to death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.56. &amp; 27.1. So they that have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts, when they have found out their ſins, they ask counſel of God, how they may put them to death, how and by what means they may be delivered from their ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Jews had taken counſel to put Chriſt to death, they carry him to <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pilate,</hi> and there they accuſe him, and cry out to have him crucified, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.3. <hi>The chief Priest accuſed him of many things, ver.</hi> 13. <hi>They cryed out crucifie him.</hi> So they that have crucified the fleſh and the luſts and affections, accuſe themſelves before God, for their ſinful hearts, and their vile affections, and corrupt luſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>We all are as an unclean thing, Job</hi> 40.4. <hi>Behold I am vile.</hi> And they cry out to God to Crucifie their luſts, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from all their Tranſgreſſions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.8. <hi>Deliver me from all my Tranſgreſſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. They judged and condemned Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pilate,</hi> and ſaid that by their Law he ought
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:105607:50"/>to dye, and would not let <hi>Pilate</hi> reſt till he had condemned him, and delivered him up to be crucified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.7. <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye,</hi> Mark 14.64. <hi>They all condemned him to be guilty of death, Luk.</hi> 23.24. <hi>And Pilate gave ſentence that it ſhould be as they required.</hi> So they that have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts, judge and condemn themſelves in the preſence of God, as worthy to dye eternally. And they judge and condemn their ſins, they are ſatisfied in their judgements that according to the Law of God they ought to put their ſin to death, and they will give God no reſt till he hath ſent his Spirit into their hearts, to Crucifie the fleſh with the luſts and affections.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Jews after Chriſt was Condemned, hung him up on the Croſs, and made him faſt with Nails to the Croſs, and would not ſuffer him to be taken down, till he had given up the Ghoſt. So they that have Crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts, do lay hold on Chriſt Crucified, for the Crucifying their fleſh with all its corrupt luſts. And it is the ſixed purpoſe of their hearts by the help of Chriſt, to ſuppreſs all ſinfull luſts and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections, and to refrain from all ſinfull ſpeeches and practices. Thus <hi>David</hi> was carefull to ſuppreſs and keep down Pride in his heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. <hi>Lord my heart is not haughty</hi>— And to ſuppreſs the frowardneſs and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105607:50"/>diſcontent of his heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.4. <hi>A fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heart ſhall depart from me.</hi> If froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs got into his heart, under the diſorders and croſſes that were in his family, he would not ſuffer it to abide with him, it ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart from him, he was carefull alſo to ſuppreſs inordinate affections to the World. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.36. <hi>Encline my heart to thy Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and not unto Covetouſneſs.</hi> And all other evil inclinations of his heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.4. <hi>Encline not my heart to any evil thing.</hi> And as he was carefull to ſuppreſs evil luſts in his heart, ſo to refrain from evil ſpeeches and ſinfull prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.1. <hi>I ſaid, I will take heed to my ways, that I ſin not with my Tongue, I will keep my Mouth with a Bridle, while the wicked is before me. Pſal.</hi> 119.101. <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evil way.</hi> They that ſeek by the help of Chriſt to ſuppreſs evil luſts and inordinate affections, and refrain from ſinfull ſpeeches and practices, have Crucified the fleſh with the luſts and affections.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Jews having heard that after Chriſt was Crucified, he would riſe again, put him into a Grave, and rolled a great ſtone upon the mouth of the Grave, and ſet a ſtrict watch, and did all that they could to prevent his riſing again. So they that have Crucified the fleſh with the luſts and affections do what they can to prevent the riſing of ſin in their hearts, and the breaking of it forth in their lives. They
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105607:51"/>ſet a watch over their lips and lives. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my ways, that I ſin not with my Tongue. Pſal.</hi> 141.3. <hi>Set a watch O Lord before my mouth, keep the door of my lips. Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity. Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of Life.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> I am under doubtings whether I am Chriſts, becauſe it is ſaid they that are Chriſts have Crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts. Now though I deſire and endeavour to Crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts, yet I can't ſay I have attained to it. Though I endeavour to ſuppreſs all evil luſtings, and all inordinate affections, and to refrain from every evil way, yet I ſtill find the fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the law in my members warring againſt the law of my mind, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me captive to the law of ſin and death. And therefore I fear I am none of Chriſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Such as are united to Chriſt, have Fleſh as well as Spirit in them, and do find the luſtings of the Fleſh againſt the Spirit, and the warring of the law in their members, againſt the law of their mind, but they do not walk after the Fleſh but after the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaking of ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105607:51"/>ſaith not, they have no fleſh, nothing of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in them, that there is nothing but the Spirit of Grace in them, but he ſaith of them, they walk not after the fleſh but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The <hi>Galatians</hi> were the children of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Yet they had in them, the Fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, whereby they were hindered that they could not do that good which they were willing and deſirous to do. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other, ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was Chriſts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. <hi>If any man truſt to himſelf that he is Chriſts, let him of himſelf think this again, that as he is Chriſts, even ſo we are Chriſts.</hi> Yet this Apoſtle (who if any man upon earth might be confident that he was Chriſts, he would let him know that he was Chriſts alſo) ſaw and complained of a law in his Members, warring againſt the law of his Mind, and leading him captive to the law of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>But I ſee another law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to the law of ſin, which is in my Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. They that heartily deſire to have the fleſh with the affections and luſts crucified, they have already crucified their ſins in their hearts. What we are willing and deſirous to do, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:105607:52"/>the Scripture accounts as if it were already done. As it is in the Commiſſion, what ſins we deſire to commit, God accounts them to be committed in our hearts. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.28. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever looketh upon a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his heart.</hi> So it is with the crucifixion of ſin when a man looks upon his ſins and ſaith in the ſincerity of his heart; oh that my fleſh with the affections and luſts were crucified he may be ſaid to have crucified his fleſh with the luſts and affections.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They that are Chriſts have delivered up their corrupt natures, with all the affections and luſts to be crucified. We read of Chriſt that he was delivered to the Jews to be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Then delivered he him to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> The hypocrite ſpares his ſins, and hides them, and is unwilling to part with them, <hi>Job</hi> 20.12, 13. But it is not ſo with a true Chriſtian, to deliver up all his ſins to be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and begs earneſtly of God, that he would not ſuffer any ſin to have the dominion over him, but that he may be delivered from all his tranſgreſſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.133. <hi>Order my ſteps in thy word, and let not any iniquity have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over me,</hi> Pſal. 39.8. <hi>Deliver me from all my tranſgreſſions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. We may be ſaid to have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts, when we have begun to mortifie all our ſins, when we make it our daily care and endeavour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs evil luſts and inordinate affections, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105607:52"/>to refrain our feet from every evil way. Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion is a lingring death. Our ſins are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, when they are dying, though not fully dead. Perſons nayled to the Croſs had many ſtruglings before they gave up the ghoſt, and yet they might be ſaid to be crucified while they hung upon the Croſs, though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly dead. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I dye daily.</hi> So a Chriſtian makes it his daily buſineſs to dye to his ſins. And what we are truly and heartily endeavouring to do, that the Lord eſteemeth and accepts as if it were done. <hi>Abraham</hi> in the ſincerity of his heart endeavouring to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks of it and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it, as if it had been actually done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.17. <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tryed, offered up his ſon Iſaac.</hi>

                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Obeying Chriſt is a ſure evidence of a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt, for he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor not only of Temporal but Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only to ſome, but to all them that obey him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>And being made perfect he became the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi>

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:105607:60"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Though you come ſhort in your obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Precepts of Chriſt, yet can't you ſay, you have ſought his Precepts? <hi>David</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that he was the Lords, becauſe he had ſought his Precepts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. <hi>I am thine, ſave me, for I have ſought thy Precepts.</hi> Now when may we be ſaid to have ſought Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. When we are deſirous to know the Commandments of God, in order to doing them, and therefore when any doubtfull caſes occurr, we will do nothing raſhly, till we have conſidered whither it be agreeable to the Commandments of God, and when we can't find out what the Lord hath commanded, in this or the other thing, we go to God to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his will to us; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.12, 19. <hi>Teach me thy Statutes— hide not thy Commandements from me.</hi> When we thus ſeek to God to teach and reveal his will to us, we may be ſaid to ſeek his Precepts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſeek Gods Precepts, when we ſeek to him for grace to keep his Precepts, and ſay with <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 119.5. <hi>Oh that my ways were directed, that I could keep thy Precepts. Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an argument that we love Chriſt, and ſo conſequently that we have an intereſt in him, when we ſet his Commandements before us as our rule, and walk after them, though we be not able to walk up to them. 2 <hi>Ep. Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>And this is love that we walk after his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Though you can't obey Chriſt perfectly, yet are you not willing and deſirous to obey Chriſt better, even to obey him in all things? It is an argument that a man hath a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and is in a good eſtate, when he is willing in all things to live Honeſtly. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. <hi>We trust we have a good Conſcience in all things, willing to live honestly.</hi>

               <p>IF Intereſt in Chriſt be a ground of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under all the troubles of this Life, then let us ſeek comfort in Chriſt and from Chriſt, under national troubles; when ruin and deſolation is coming upon the Nations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Forreign Invaſion, or by Tumults, Inſurrections, or Maſſacres at home, when dreadful judgments as the Sword, Peſtilence, or Famine are upon us, in the worſt times imaginable, there is comfort to be had in Chriſt, as you may ſee from ſuch Scriptures as theſe. <hi>Mich.</hi> 5.5. <hi>And this man ſhall be the peace, when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into the Land.</hi> The man ſpoken of here, is the man Chriſt Jeſus, who being the Son of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man for our ſakes. That the Prophet is here treating of Chriſt, who was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what is ſaid of this man, that he ſhall be the peace, is applyed to Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For he is our peace.</hi> Now it is ſaid of our Lord Jeſus, that he ſhall be the peace, when a Forreign Enemy ſhould invade the Land, namely, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhould come into
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:105607:61"/>the land. And what manner of People were theſe <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.23. And Idolaters are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemies to the Worſhippers of the true God. They were great enemies to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and came with open mouth to devour the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites. Iſa.</hi> 9.12. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were <hi>the rod of Gods anger, and the ſtaff of his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> who was ſent by God to tread down a ſinful people, like mire in the ſtreets. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.5, 6. Yet Chriſt was the peace of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſuch a diſmal and bloody day, when the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was ſent into the land, to tread down all ranks and degrees of men, like mire in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture that ſhews us there is comfort to be had in Chriſt in times of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confuſion, when all places and perſons are in an uproar, and all things are turned upſide down, and there is no peace to be had either at ſea or land. We have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.4. <hi>There is a River, the Streams whereof make glad the City of God.</hi> For opening this Scripture, let us conſider. This River may ſignifie the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; For it is ſaid of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2. <hi>He ſhall be as Rivers of water in a dry place.</hi> Is is frequent with the Scriptures to ſet out Chriſt by a Fountain, and Rivers of Waters. As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.21. <hi>The glorious Lord will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a place of broad Rivers. Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a Fountain opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jer.</hi> 2.14. <hi>They have forſaken me, the Fountain
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105607:62"/>of Living VVaters.</hi> All the gladneſs of the City of God comes from this River, namely, from Chriſt the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The ſtreams that iſſue from this River are the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that we have from Chriſt, as pardon of ſin, reconciliation with God, hope of eternal life, and the like, and all thoſe good things which God for Chriſts ſake giveth to us, and doth for us. The fruits and benefits which we have by the death and interceſſion of Chriſt, are a great refreſhing to the people of God in their greateſt troubles. When the Spouſe of Chriſt was under the ſcorching heat of perſecution, She found great delight and ſweetneſs in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on thoſe benefits ſhe had by Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet unto my taſt.</hi> The benefits we have by Chriſt, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all thoſe great things which the Lord hath been wont to do for his People in all ages, which puts great gladneſs into their hearts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.3. <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</hi> [The City of God] which is made glad by the ſtreams of this River, are the people of God in all ages, and all places of the world. Now let us ſee [what diſmal times] are pointed at, what great calamities are mentioned in this Pſalm, under all which the City of God is made glad, by the ſtreams that iſſue from this River.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſuppoſeth ſuch times wherein the earth ſhould be removed, and carried into the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105607:62"/>midſt of the Sea, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. which ſignifieth the utter and irrecoverable deſtruction of mighty Kingdoms, for its uſual with the Scripture to ſet out States and Kingdoms by Mountains, and the deſtruction and deſolation of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, by removing the earth, and removing the mountains. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.1, 3, 19, 20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.25. The removing theſe mountains into the midſt of the Sea, may ſignifie their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and irrecoverable deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of the roaring of the waters, and their being troubled, and the mountains ſhaking with the ſwelling thereof, and this may ſignifie great tumults and uproars among the people, ſuch as may make the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hearted perſons to tremble. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.4. <hi>Thine enemies roar in the midſt of thy Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Scripture ſetteth forth multitudes of people by waters. As <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.15. And the roaring of theſe waters make the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſhake, that is, make the ſtouteſt and moſt couragious men to fear and tremble. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</hi> When ungodly men that have no fear of God before their eyes, were in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, were gathered together, and bore down all before them like a flood, it made even <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> himſelf to be afraid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the removing the earth and roaring of the waters are meant all places, being full of trouble, wars at Sea and Land, the whole world full of ſtirs and commotions, yet we will not fear.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:105607:63"/>
               <p n="4">4. What the Pſalmiſt expreſſed Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically <hi>ver.</hi> 2.3. he expreſſeth more plainly <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>The Heathen raged, the Kingdoms were moved, he uttered his voice, the earth melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> That is, there ſhould be ſuch dreadfull judgments called for by God, ſuch ragings of the Heathen, ſuch commotions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, as ſhould make mens hearts to melt with grief and fear. For the heart is melted with grief. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.28. <hi>My Soul melteth for heavineſs. Luk.</hi> 21.26. <hi>Mens hearts fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for fear.</hi>

And here we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome of theſe ſtreams of this River, ſome of theſe benefits we have by Chriſt, which are matters of joy in our greateſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:105607:63"/>which are hinted in this Pſalm.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Lords people ſhall through Chriſt and for Chriſts ſake have the Lords preſence with them in all the commotions and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that come upon the world, and this makes glad the City of God, and ſettles the faith and hope of the people of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>God is in the midſt of her, ſhe ſhall not be moved, ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The Lord of hoſts is with us.</hi> This is three times mentioned, that the Lord is with his people, as being a prime antidote to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell their fears, and comfort their hearts, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear not I am with thee,</hi> yea under diſmal calamities, when the Lord is pouring out his fury, and is pleading againſt us with fire and ſword, and is leading his people through the depths of trouble and fiery tryals, this is a ſingular comfort, to have God with us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.24, 25. compared with 43.1, 2.</item>
                  <item>2. Another of thoſe ſtreams which make glad the City of God under calamitous times, is that they have a refuge to flee to, and that this refuge is God himſelf, and that this God who is their refuge is the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> This is alſo three times hinted in this Pſalm, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 7, 11. <hi>God is our refuge,—The God of Jacob is our refuge, The God of Jacob is our refuge.</hi> It is comfortable to have a refuge to flee to in a ſtorm, a refuge to flee to where we may be ſafe. But moſt comfortable to have God himſelf, the great God, the eternal God, the Al-mighty, Al-ſufficient God, the faithfull
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105607:64"/>God, the infinitely near and gracious, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, for our refuge. And it is an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our comfort, that this God who is our refuge, hath ſtiled himſelf the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> For that implyeth,

That he that was <hi>Jacobs</hi> refuge when he was in great diſtreſs, and afraid of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> who hated <hi>Jacob,</hi> and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up a reſolution to kill him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.41. And to come againſt <hi>Jacob</hi> with four hundred men, which made <hi>Jacob</hi> afraid that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to kill him and his wives and children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.6, 7, 11. yet God was <hi>Jacobs</hi> refuge in this great ſtrait, and ſo over-ruled <hi>Eſau's</hi> heart, that he did <hi>Jacob</hi> no harm.</item>
                        <item>(2.) That God is and will be a refuge to poor weak and ſhiftleſs creatures, ſuch as are but worms in their own and others account, deſpicable perſons, he will help and take care of them in the time of trouble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.13, 14. <hi>I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, ſaying unto thee fear not, I will help thee.

Another ſtream iſſuing from this river, which maketh glad the City of God, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is, that God will be his people's ſtrength in troublous times, and a preſent help both in trouble and out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 5. <hi>God is our ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble — God ſhall help her and that right early.</hi> Now this is a great comfort to have God for our ſtrength, and help in all our troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.1. <hi>The king ſhall cry in thy ſtrength, O Lord,</hi> Pſal. 28.7. <hi>The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſhield, my heart truſted in him and I am helped, therefore my heart greatly rejoyceth, and with my ſong will I praiſe him.</hi> I will inſtance in ſome grounds of conſolation, under natural troubles, as invaſion of Forreign Enemies, Maſſacres, Peſtilence, or other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating judgements.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. It is a great ground of comfort to all the members of Chriſt under national calamities, that there is nothing done in the world, or to any Kingdom, or any City, or any particular perſon but by the Providence, of God. I ſhall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105607:65"/>Prove this, that all things that are done in the world, come to paſs by the providence of God, and then ſhew how this is a ground of comfort in all Publick calamities, as well as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and perſonal afflictions. That there is nothing done in the world, in any Kingdom, in any City, to any perticular perſon, but by the providence of God, is evident from ſuch Scriptures as theſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever. Iſa.</hi> 45.7. <hi>I form the light, and create darkneſs, I make peace, and create evil, I the Lord do all theſe things— Am.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Whatſoever evil comes upon a City, or any perſon in the City, whether Sword, or Peſtilence, or Famine, or Fire, or any other evil it is the Lord that ſends all thoſe evils. When any deſtroyers come againſt a Nation, that lay it waſt, and make it deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, it is the Lord that raiſeth up thoſe waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to deſtroy, and furniſheth them with all their ſlaughter weapons, and their inſtruments to carry on the deſigned deſtruction. <hi>Iſa</hi> 54.16. <hi>Behold I have created the Smith that blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth all inſtruments for his work, and I have created the waſter to deſtroy.</hi> Such calamities as ſeem to be carried on in a confuſed diſorderly way, are governed and over-ruled by the providence of God, ſo that there is no damage done to any mans perſon or eſtate, but by the appointment
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105607:65"/>of God. <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.3. <hi>The Lord hath his way in the ſtorm, and in the whirlwind.</hi> That is, the Lord orders all things that are done by the ſtorm, and by the whirlwind, and by all other judgments that come as ſuddenly as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, as confuſedly as the ſtorm or the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind— When the Sword or Peſtilence come upon any place, the Lord numbers all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhall be ſlain by the Sword, and that ſhall dye by the Peſtilence. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.12. <hi>Therefore will I number you to the Sword, and ye ſhall all bow down to the ſlaughter. Jer.</hi> 15.2. VVhen any man ſuffers by Fire, Hail, Snow, or ſtormy VVinds, he ſuffers nothing but what God hath appointed him to ſuffer, for the Fire, Snow, Hail, ſtormy Winds, and all other creatures fulfill Gods word, they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to any man but what God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour, ſtor my wind fulfilling his word. Mich.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Hear the rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</hi> Every rod hath its whole work appointed by God. The Sea ſeems to be a very unruly creature, eſpecially when ſtormy winds cauſeth it to rage, yet the Lord ruleth the raging of the Sea, and ſuffers it to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in its greateſt rage, but what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.9. <hi>Thou ruleſt the raging of the Sea, when the Waves thereof ariſe, thou ſtilleſt them.</hi> And he that ruleth the raging of the Sea, ruleth and ſtilleth the tumults of the moſt unruly people. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.7. Yea, he ruleth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105607:66"/>over all perſons and all actions that are done in any part of the world. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.19. <hi>The Lords Throne is in the Heavens, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth over all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is a ground of comfort to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in Tumults, and Inſurrections, and Maſſacres, and all other National judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there is nothing comes to paſs, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing befalls any Kingdom, City, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon, but by the providence of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1, 2, 3. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoyce— Clouds and Darkneſs are round about him, Righteouſneſ and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.

               <p n="1">1. That God who ruleth and diſpoſeth of all things by his providence is our God, and our Father in Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.10. <hi>The Lord ſhall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations, praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> This is matter of praiſe and joy to <hi>Zion,</hi> not only that God reigneth, but that he which doth and ſhall reign for ever is <hi>Zions</hi> God. <hi>Thy God O Zion Reigneth unto all generations; praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> The conſideration of our Fathers hand in ordering all our afflictions may ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the bittereſt cup which he at any time puts into our hands. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me ſhall I not drink it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Whatſoever the Lord doth is done in Righteouſneſs, when he breaks in pieces King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations, this is matter of comfort, God will do nothing to any place or people, but what is conſiſtent with Righteouſneſs. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48.10, 11. <hi>Thy right hand is full of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, let Mount Zion rejoyce, let the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Judah be glad, becauſe of thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord who ruleth the world by his providence is a mercifull and gracious God, that will compaſs his own people with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, at ſuch a time as he is diſtributing ſorrows in great abundance to wicked men. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Many ſorrows ſhall be to the wicked, but he that truſteth in the Lord, mercy ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs him about.</hi> Even when he lets his own people fall into the hands of cruel enemies,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105607:67"/>ſuch as hate them, he is mindfull of his mercy towards them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.42, 43, 45.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This God who ruleth and governeth the world, and diſpoſeth all things that are done therein by his providence, is a God in Covenant with us, that he will never turn away from doing us good. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good</hi>—This was ſpoken to the Jews, when they were under very dark providences, the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> Army had Beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and God told them by his Prophet that he would give <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> hands. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. And beſides the Sword of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the City was viſited with the Famine and Peſtilence. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. Yet under theſe ſad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences God comforts his people with his Everlaſting Covenant, wherein he aſſures them that though they were ſurrounded with all theſe evils, the Sword, the Famine, and the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yet he would not turn away from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them good. Whatever aſpect ſome of Gods providences may have upon the world, and the Sinners in <hi>Zion,</hi> yet they are all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and truth to the people of God, even when they have the greateſt appearance of ſeverity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth to ſuch as keep his Covenant, and his Testimonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord hath wiſe and holy ends in the changes and deſolations that he makes in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105607:67"/>earth; And the conſideration of the Holineſs and Wiſdom of God in all his works, may be a ſtay to our minds, when he over-turns Kingdoms and Nations. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.4. <hi>Sing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, O ye Saints of his, give thanks at the remembrance of his Holineſs. Dan.</hi> 2.20.21. <hi>Bleſſed be the name of God for ever and for ever, for wiſdom and might are his, and he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the times and the ſeaſons, he removeth Kings, and he ſetteth up Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſpecial care which the Lord taketh of all his people at all times is a ground of great comfort in times of danger and Publick ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities. The Lord taketh a ſpecial care of all his people at all times, and this may quiet their minds and free them from perplexing fears and cares, in times of greateſt danger and diſtreſs, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 5.7. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> The perſons to whom this Epiſtle was written were in great diſtreſs, they were ſcattered abroad into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2. <hi>To the ſtrangers ſcattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Aſia, Bythinia.</hi> They were in heavineſs through the manifold temptations, they met with in their perſecuted ſcattered condition, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. They were under great and ſore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, not onely the hand, but the mighty hand of God was upon them, <hi>Ch.</hi> 5.6. yet in this ſcattered condition, when they were in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through manifold temptations when they were under the mighty hand of God, the Apoſtle
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105607:68"/>comforts them with this, that they had a God that took care of them, and therefore they needed not to perplex and diſquiet their minds with any kind of cares, but may caſt them all upon God. <hi>Caſting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> That we may be the more comforted in time of danger, by the care that the Lord taketh of us, let us conſider what manner of care it is wherewith the Lord careth for us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a ſpecial care which the Lord taketh of his people. There is a common care which he taketh of all his creatures. He feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fowls of the Air, he clotheth the graſs of the field, he ſatisfieth the deſire of every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, he preſerveth man and beaſt. But the care, which God taketh of the children of men, is far greater than what he takes of the beaſts of the birds, or any other creatures in this world. The care that God hath of the ſons of men ſo far exceeds his care of other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that it ſeems as no care compared with that care which he takes for mankind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? Or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? for our ſakes no doubt this is written.</hi> And as God takes care of men above all other creatures, ſo he takes a more ſpecial care of his own people than he doth of all other men. They are to him as the apple of his eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Het hat toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105607:68"/>eye.</hi> They are his jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>They ſhall be mine ſaith the Lord of hoſts, in that day when I make up my jewels, and I will ſpare them as a man spareth his own ſon that ſerveth him.</hi> They are his peculiar treaſure, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Ye ſhall be unto me a peculiar treaſure above all people, for all the earth is mine.</hi> They are his portion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>The Lords portion is his people.</hi> How careful are men of their portion, their peculiar treaſure, their jewels, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their eye; ſo, and much more careful is the Lord of his people. They are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. And in times of danger men are very ſolicitous for their children. The firſt queſtion that <hi>David</hi> put to both thoſe meſſengers that came with tydings from the battel was, concerning the ſafety of his child. <hi>Is the young man Abſalom ſafe,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.29, 32.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a particular care. The Lord doth not onely take care of his people in general, but of every one of them in particular, and of every thing that belongeth to them. When God is deſtroying wicked men, he taketh care for the preſervation of every one of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.20. <hi>The Lord preſerveth all them that love him, but all the wicked will he deſtroy.</hi> In times of greateſt calamity, when he breaks a kingdom in pieces, and ſcatters the inhabitants thereof into all parts of the world, he will take care of every one of the members of Chriſt, even the leaſt and meaneſt, and moſt ſhiftleſs of all his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105607:69"/>ſervants, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.9. <hi>For lo I will command, and I will ſift the houſe of Iſrael among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like as corn is ſifted in a ſive, yet ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the ground.</hi> Say not in thy heart, God hath ſo many to take care of, he may forget me, or I am ſuch a mean creature he will not regard me. For it is all one with God to take care of many as few, and he takes care of the loweſt as well as the higheſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.6. <hi>Though the Lord be high yet he hath reſpect unto the lowly.</hi> There are a great company of Sparrows, and they are birds of but ſmall value, yet not one of the Sparrows is forgotten of God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.6.7. <hi>Are not five Sparrows ſold for two farthings? and not one of them is forgotten before God - Fear not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ye are of more value than many Sparrows.</hi> In the 4th. verſe Chriſt ſaith to them. <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body.</hi> And gives two arguments to diſſwade them from fearing them, that can only kill the body. Firſt, that is the worſt they can do, <hi>after that they have no more that they can do.</hi> And the other is, they can't do this but by the permiſſion of God, for he that watcheth over every Sparrow doth much more watch over every man, who is of more value than many Sparrows. There are many devices to take away the lives of the Sparrows, as Nets, Snares, Fowling-pieces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides the danger they are in by the greater birds, who pray upon the leſſer ones, yet not one Sparrow is killed, but by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105607:69"/>of God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Are not two Sparrows ſold for a farthing, and one of them ſhall not fall on the ground without your father.</hi> Though we have many that lye in wait to take away our lives, and the inſtruments of Death are prepared for us, yet not one man, woman or child ſhall fall to the ground, and be cut off from the land of the living, without our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fathers appointment. And as the Lord taketh a particular care of every Member of Chriſt, ſo alſo of all the affairs and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Members of Chriſt. He ſets the hedge of his providence not only about their perſons, but about all that they have on every ſide. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Haſt thou not made an hedge about him, and about his houſe, and about all that he hath on every ſide.</hi> His care extends even to the leaſt of all their concernments, to the very hairs of their heads. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30. <hi>But the very hairs of your head, are all numbred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a conſtant and continual care. He takes care of them at all times, both by night and by day, and in all places, when they go out and come in, at home and abroad. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it, I will water it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, leaſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> This promiſe relates to the Lords Vineyard, mentioned in the foregoing verſe. And by his Vineyard is meant all the members, all that belong to Chriſt, who is the true Vine. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am the vine. Iſa.</hi> 5.7. <hi>The vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105607:70"/>of the Lord of hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> This vineyard being expoſed to many adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if the hedge ſhould be removed from the vineyard, every one would be ready to pluck the vines. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.12, 13. Therefore the Lord himſelf doth and will keep it. <hi>I the Lord do keep it—I will keep it.</hi> And ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs of Gods care for his vineyard, both as to the perſons and times, he will keep it from being hurt by any perſon at any time. <hi>Leaſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> And conſider the times to which this promiſe relates, and they are times of greateſt danger. VVhen God is taking his ſore, and great and long Sword into his hand to puniſh his, and his Churches Adverſaries, which are as ſubtle as Serpents, as cruel as the Dragon, as ſtrong and potent as the Leviathan. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. It relates alſo to that day wherein God is riſing out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquities. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 21. In that day when he is puniſhing the inhabitants of the earth, and ſending ſore judgments on ſuch, as are like the Serpents and Dragons, he will keep his vineyard night and day leaſt any hurt it. Another Scripture that ſets out the conſtancy of Gods care for his People's wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. VVe have <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.5, 6, 7. <hi>Behold he that keepeth Iſrael will not ſlumber nor ſleep. The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy ſhade upon thy right hand. The Sun ſhall not ſmite thee by day, nor the Moon by night. The Lord
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105607:70"/>ſhall preſerve thee from all evil.</hi> How ſafe are they that have the Lord for their Keeper? when we ſleep and can take no care of our ſelves, he that keepeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nor ſleepeth. He keepeth us from all evil by night and by day. For that is the meaning of <hi>the Sun ſhall not ſmite thee by day, nor the Moon by night.</hi> For the Sun that ruleth the day, and the Moon that ruleth the night. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.16. 'Tis as much as to ſay, he will keep us from all harms, he will keep us in ſafety day and night. The care that the Lord taketh of his people, is like the care that God took of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.12. <hi>A Land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year.</hi> Such is the care that the Lord hath of his people, his eyes are always upon them for good, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year to the end of the year. The Lord taketh care of all his people from the day of their birth, yea from their being in the womb to their old age, yea to the day of our death. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. <hi>ult. He will be our guide even untill death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Lord taketh the care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all times, both by night and by day, ſo alſo in all places, whitherſoever they go, he goeth with them to keep them in all places, and to preſerve their going out, and their coming in. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Lord thy God is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105607:71"/>with thee, whitherſoever thou goeſt. Gen.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Behold I am with thee, to keep thee in all places whither thou goeſt. Pſal.</hi> 121.8. <hi>The Lord ſhall preſerve thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth, and even for evermore.</hi> What a comfort is this, when the way we are to paſs through is full of danger, either by reaſon of the Sword or Peſtilence, or any other evil, that we have a God, that will go along with us, whitherſoever we go.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That care which the Lord taketh of his people is a wonderfull great care, the Lord Jeſus is ſo carefull of all his Members, that they are never out of his eye, <hi>Job</hi> 36.7. <hi>He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous,</hi> whether they go into any parts of the earth, ſtill his eyes are upon them for good, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole earth to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect towards him.</hi> And the greater their dangers are, the more the eye of God is upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.18, 19. <hi>Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſoul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</hi> The Lord would have us take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice for our comfort, that when we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death by famine or other judgments, his eye is upon us, and therefore there is a note of attention prefixed, <hi>Behold the eye of the Lord</hi>—The Lord is ſo carefull of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105607:71"/>that they are never out of his thoughts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 442. <hi>O Iſrael thou ſhalt not be forgotten of me.</hi> What the Lord ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> temple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Mine eyes and mine heart ſhall be there perpetually.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of all true Chriſtians, who are the temple of <hi>God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Gods</hi> eyes and his heart are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them perpetually. The Lord is ſo careful of his people, that they are never out of his arms, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3, 27. <hi>All his Saints are in thy hand—The eternal God is thy refuge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath are the everlaſting armes.</hi> He is ſo carefull of his people that he layes his lambs and carries them in his boſom, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his flock like a ſhepherd, he ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his lambs with his arm, and carry them in his boſom.</hi> When the Wolves are abroad, the lambs are ſafe as long as they are in the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds boſom.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Lord is exceeding carefull of all his people himſelf, ſo alſo he hath ſent forth all his Angels to miniſter to their neceſſities, and given them a great charge to keep them in all their wayes, and to enca up round about them, and deliver them out of all their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them whoſhall be heirs of ſalvation, Pſal.</hi> 91.11, 12. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy wayes, they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> The angels have a charge to keep us in all our
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105607:72"/>wayes, whether ſoever we go, in all the wayes of our general and particular calling, they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, as nurſes carry their children, having them alwayes in their eye, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone. They have a charge not onely to keep us from great but from leſſer evils, not onely from bruiſing our bodies, breaking our necks, or our bones, but from daſhing our feet againſt a ſtone. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</hi> Suppoſe the times be very dangerous, yet as long as we have a guard of Angels about us, we need not be afraid. One Angel is a better guard and ſecurity to us, than an Army of an Hundred Thouſand Men. Angels have greater power than the greateſt and moſt valiant Armies of Armed men. VVe read of a great Army, an Hundred Fourſcore and Five Thouſand Men, deſtroyed in a night by one Angel. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.36. And therefore ſuch as fear God are in a ſafe condition in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, becauſe the Angels of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp round about them to deliver them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> How is this true, that the <hi>Lord</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuch a ſpecial, continual exceeding great care of all his Peopole, when many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God fall into very great ſtraits and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and though they cry to God, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to regard them, but they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forgotten and forſaken of God.</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:105607:72"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Eminent dangers, and great tribu lations, accompanied with a long deferring of deſired and expectd help, have ſtaggered the Faith of eminent Saints, and made them ready to think that God did not regard them, and took no care of them. <hi>Job.</hi> 30.20. <hi>I cry unto thee and thou doſt not hear, I ſtand up and thou regardeſt me not.</hi> When the Diſciples were in a great ſtorm, and ready to periſh, they were ready to think that Chriſt took no care of them. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.38. <hi>Maſter careſt thou not that we periſh? Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>Zion ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Sharp afflictions and long exerciſes of Faith and Patience are conſiſtent with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love of God, and his tender care over us. He may chide us for our faults, ſpeak againſt us, write and act bitter things againſt us. and yet have a dear love to us, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and affectionate remembrance of us. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Ever ſince I ſpake against him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill, therefore my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are troubled for him.</hi> God ſpake againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> God acted againſt <hi>Ephraim— Thou haſt chaſtiſed me</hi>— Yet <hi>Ephraim</hi> was his dear Son, his pleaſant Child, he had an earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him, and his bowels were troubled for him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Whom I love, I rebuke and chaſten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If we conſult Gods word, and judge of Gods dealings with us by Faith, and not by
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105607:73"/>Senſe, Faith will teach us to ſay God is with us, and takes care of us, when Senſe ſaith God hath forgotten and forſaken us. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14, 15, 16. <hi>Zion</hi> was graven upon the palms of Gods hands, and her walls were continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Lord, and God was more mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her, than any Mother of her ſucking Child, when ſhe thought her ſelf forgotten and forſaken of God.</p>
               <p>Now this care which the Lord takes of his people is a ground of great comfort in all their troubles. VVhen <hi>Paul</hi> was a Priſoner at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was a great comfort to him in his Bonds, when he underſtood the care that the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took of him. <hi>Phil</hi> 4.10. <hi>But I rejoyced in the Lord greatly, that now at the laſt your care of me hath flouriſh'd, again, wherein, you were carefull; but ye lacked opportunity.</hi> If the Apoſtle had great joy to ſee that the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> took care of him in his Bonds, what joy may it be to us, to hear of the care that the great God takes of us in all our troubles. VVhat is the care of a man, to the care of a God? The <hi>Philippians</hi> care of the Apoſtle was unconſtant, one while they were mindfull of him, and then they either forgot or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as appears by that expreſſion, <hi>your care of me hath flouriſhed again,</hi> which imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a decay in their care, and it was a good while before it flouriſhed again as is intimated in thoſe words; <hi>now at laſt your care of me</hi> — But Gods care is conſtant without intermiſſion.

That God who ruleth and governeth the world by his providence, and taketh ſuch a great care of his, is an infinitely wiſe God, and the wiſdom and knowledge of God is a ground of great comfort under all Perſonal and National Calamities. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.7. <hi>I will be glad and rejoyce in thy mercy, for thou haſt conſidered my trouble, thou haſt known my Soul in adverſities.</hi> It was a great comfort to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> that God knew all his adverſities, and conſidered all his troubles. VVhen <hi>Daniel</hi> foreſaw the great changes God would make in the world, in removing Kings and ſetting up Kings, and changing the Monarchies and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105607:74"/>government of the Kingdoms of the earth, the conſideration of the wiſdom of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in thoſe changes and revolutions, made him break out into bleſſing and praiſing God. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.20, 21. <hi>Bleſſed be the name of God for ever and ever; for Wiſdom and Might are his, And he changeth the times and the ſeaſors, he removeth Kings, and he ſetteth up Kings, Yet Daniel</hi> who bleſſed God for changing times and ſeaſons, knew that ſometimes when God makes changes in Kingdoms, he ſets up the baſeſt of men to be Rulers. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. <hi>The moſt high ruleth in the Kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will, and ſetteth ever it the baſeſt of men.</hi> That we may ſee what comfort ariſeth from the wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in times of great diſtreſs, let us conſider theſe 4 or 5 things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord knoweth who are his, who they are that put their truſt in him, and make God their refuge, he can call them every one by their names, ſo that there is no danger that any of his ſhould periſh through a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, in times of confuſion, when he is ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his judgments upon wicked men. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> Some of the Lords People walk in darkneſs, and do not know that they are the Lords, but there is no darkneſs with the Lord, he knoweth them that are his. <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Lord is good, a ſtrong hold in the day of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:105607:74"/>trouble, and he knoweth them that truſt in him.</hi> The Lord hath ſuch perfect knowledge of all that are his, that whereſoever they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed or ſcattered into any parts of the world, he can call them every one by name. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.3, 14. <hi>He calleth his own ſheep by name, and leadeth them out— I am the good Shepherd, and know my Sheep.</hi> The Stars are ſo many that no man can number them, yet the Lord calleth every one of them by their name. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.4. <hi>He telleth the number of the Stars, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them all by their names.</hi> And he that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Stars by their names he knoweth, and can call every one by his name. Now this is a great comfort to us, that God knoweth us by name. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of it as a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that God knew him by name. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.12. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid I know thee by name, and thou haſt found grace in my ſight</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord knoweth how to guide and direct his judgments, that they ſhall fall upon, and take hold of thoſe only that are marked out, and deſigned for deſtruction. What is ſaid of the Thunder and Lightning. <hi>Job.</hi> 37.3. <hi>He directeth it under the whole Heaven, and his Lightnings unto the end of the earth.</hi> The Thunder and Lightning touch no perſon, do no damage to any man. but at the direction of God. The ſame is true of other judgments alſo; VVhen a certain man drew a bow at a venture, it was God guided the Arrow to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that directed it to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105607:75"/>the joynts of the Harneſs. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.34. When the Lord ſent ſeveral plagues on the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ſo ordered and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his judgments, that they fell only on the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and did not touch the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yea he did not only diſtinguiſh between the perſons of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but alſo between their Cattel. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.4. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſever between the cattel of Iſrael, and the cattel of Egypt, there ſhall nothing dye of all that is the children of Iſraels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord knoweth our conditions, what dangers we are in, what troubles and ſorrows we meet with, what ſtraits and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes are upon us. <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reaſon of their Task-maſters, for I know their ſorrows. Pſal.</hi> 38.9. <hi>Lord all my deſire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid rom thee.</hi> When we are in great ſtraits, and have friends that are able to help us, we are ready to ſay, Oh that ſuch a friend did but know how it is with me. The Child is ready to ſay, Oh that my Father knew how it was with me, and the Wife is ready to ſay in diſtreſs, Oh that my Husband knew how it was with me! Our God who is our Friend, our Father, our Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band always knoweth how it is with us, and may not this comfort us in our ſorrows.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord knoweth all our adverſaries, their wrath and fury, their plottings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105607:75"/>againſt us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.19. <hi>Mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are all before thee.</hi> When the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> came with great rage againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> their doings and contrivances were not hid from the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.28. <hi>I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lord knoweth how to deliver us out of all our troubles, when we our ſelves can't ſee or think which way we ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This God that governs the world, and takes care of his people, is acquainted with all their troubles, is an Almighty God, able to ſuccour, ſave and defend them from their greateſt danger and diſtreſſes, and this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God, is a ground of great comfort in times of greateſt dangers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1. <hi>The king ſhall joy in thy strength O Lord. David</hi> had many enemies, and ſome of them very potent, Princes were his perſecutors, and what was his comfort under all his dangers, and troubles? The power of God. It rejoyced his heart, when he conſidered what a ſtrong God he had to be his helper. The Lord himſelf propoſeth his creating power, as a ground of Comfort to his people, againſt the fury and power of their adverſaries, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.11, 12. <hi>I, even I am he that comforeth thee, who art thou, that thou
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105607:76"/>ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the Son of man which ſhall be made as graſs. And forgetteſt the Lord thy maker, that hath ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> This power of God is a ground of comfort in times of greateſt danger in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The power of God is an Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There is nothing ſo hard but the power of God is able to do it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.17. He can do every thing that he pleaſeth. <hi>Job</hi> 42.2. <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing, and that no thought can be with-holden from thee.</hi> There are no dangers ſo great but God can deliver us out of them. <hi>Daniel</hi> was in great danger when he was in a Den of Lyons, yet God delivered him out of the Lions Den. <hi>David</hi> was in greater danger than <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was in the Lyons paw, yet God delivered him out of the Lyons paw. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. <hi>Paul</hi> was in greater danger than <hi>David,</hi> who was in the Lyons mouth, yet God delivered him out of the mouth of the Lyon. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. <hi>I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion. Jonah</hi> was in greater danger than <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in the fiſhes belly, yet God delivered <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the fiſhes belly. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.1.10. God can deliver us out of the hands of the ſtrongeſt and moſt enraged enemies. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was the greateſt Monarch in the world, all People, Nations and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges trembled before him. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.19. And
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:105607:76"/>he was greatly enraged againſt the 3 Children, becauſe they would not worſhip the golden image which he had ſet up, and he threatned the ſame hour that they refuſed to worſhip his image, they ſhould be caſt into a burning fiery furnace, yet hear what they ſaid to him. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter. If it be ſo, our God whom we ſerve, is able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the burning fiery Furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This Almighty power of God is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for our defence, to take the care of us, and defend us all the days of our lives. <hi>Job</hi> 23.25. <hi>Tea the Almighty ſhall be our defence.</hi> Now this is a great comfort under greateſt troubles, that we have the Almighty God for our defence. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.19, 22. <hi>In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my Soul.</hi> And what were his comforts when he had many troubled thoughts? Among other comforts this was none of the meaneſt, that though he had mighty enemies, that thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after his blood, yet he had the Almighty God for his defence. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>But the Lord is my defence, and my God the rock of my refuge.</hi> Yea this is a ground of the higheſt joy, and of everlaſting joy, under all the changes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions that come upon the world, that the Almighty God is a defence to all that put their truſt in him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.11. <hi>But let all thoſe that put their truſt in thee rejoyce, let them ever ſhout
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105607:77"/>for joy, becauſe thou defendeſt them.</hi> Shouting for the joy is the higheſt expreſſion of joy, now they, all they that put their truſt in God, have cauſe not only to rejoyce, but to ſhout for joy, and that for ever, becauſe God defendeth them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Almighty power which is engaged for the defence of all that truſt in God, is an everlaſting ſtrength. The Lords arm is not ſhortned that he cannot ſave, he is able to do as great things for his people in theſe days, as he did for our Fathers in former days. And this may unite and ſtrengthen our Faith to truſt in the Lord at all times, though the times be never ſo dangerous and troubleſome, that his power is everlaſting. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Truſt ye in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The gracious and precious promiſes of God, are a ground of ſtrong Conſolation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all troubles, both Perſonal and National diſtreſſes. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and they were unto me the joy, and the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Obſerve <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> perſonal afflictions at this time, when the word of God was the joy and the rejoycing of his heart. He was a man of ſtrife and contention to the whole earth, and every one railed at him and curſed him, which made him cry out of his wo and miſery. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. The Lord had filled him with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:105607:77"/>and he looked upon his pain as perpetual, and his wound incurable. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.18. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his perſonal afflictions, there were great judgments coming upon the Nation; the Sword, and Famine, and Peſtilence, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.3, 4. Yet under National and Perſonal calamities, the word of God was the joy and rejoycing of his heart. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.2.3, 6. <hi>Thou haſt made the earth to tremble, thou haſt broken it— Thou haſt ſhewen thy people hard things, thou haſt made us to drink the wine of aſtoniſhment— God hath ſpoken in his holineſs, I will rejoyce.</hi> Gods promiſes were a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to <hi>Davids</hi> heart, when God ſent ſuch judgments as made the earth to tremble, and broke Kingdoms in pieces; yea when God ſhewed his own people hard things, and made them ſtand aſtoniſhed to ſee how he dealt with them, God hath made ſeveral ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to comfort his peoples hearts in difficult and dangerous times, when he is bringing ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſolation upon the places where they live. I will inſtance in ſome of them.</p>

                  <item>2. The Lord hath promiſed to deal well wit his people in times of publick calamity, even when he ſends ruine and deſtruction upon the places where they live. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.8, 10. <hi>Jeruſalem is ruined, Judah is fallen— Say ye to the righteous it ſhall be well with him. Eccl.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.11. As the ſame cloud which was dark and dreadfull to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> gave light to the <hi>Iſraelites. Exod.</hi> 14.20. So God can make thoſe providences which are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to wicked men, to be refreſhing to his own people.</item>
                  <item>3. The Lord hath promiſed to bear up the Faith and Hope of his People, that their hearts ſhall not ſink and dye within them in evil days, though very diſmal and dark days. <hi>Joel</hi> 3.15, 16.

It is a ground of comfort under Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal troubles, that God will by them bring glory to his own name, advance the Kingdom of Chriſt, and promote the good of his own people. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.15, 16.

When the Lord doth not ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a temporal Salvation under publick calamities, but lets them fall by the Sword and Peſtilence, and other judgments, as well as other men, he ſaves them with an eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.</p>

                  <p>The Spouſe enquireth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7. where he maketh his flock to reſt at noon. <hi>Tell me O thou whom my Soul loveth— where thou makeſt thy flock to reſt at noon.</hi> By noon underſtand <hi>aeſtus perſecutionis,</hi> as <hi>Mercer</hi> and others, the heat of Perſecution. The Noon is the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt time of the day. By making the flock to reſt at noon, we may underſtand, how thou comforteſt, how thou ſupporteſt thy people; how and by what means thou giveſt reſt to the Souls of thy people, in the hotteſt times of perſecution. And what the Spouſe enquired after, Chriſt diſcovered to her, namely that her reſt is in himſelf. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come to me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> And having found reſt and refreſhment in Chriſt, in the hotteſt day, ſhe tells others where ſhe had her delights and comforts in the heat of the day, and that was in Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt.</hi> Upon theſe words, <hi>I ſat down under his ſhadow with great delight.

The fruit which the Spouſe ſaith was ſweet, are the benefits we have by Chriſt, as remiſſion of ſins, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the foregoing words Chriſt is likened to an Apple-tree, and the benefits that we have by Chriſt are the Fruit of this Tree, which yields much comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people of God. And to this agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Piſcator</hi>'s note upon the place. <hi>Conſolatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Chriſti ſunt dulces animis fidelium;</hi> The comforts of Chriſt are ſweet to the Souls of Believers. There is comfort in Chriſt and from Chriſt, under the hotteſt perſecutions of the Church; if any ſay how may we be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the help of Chriſt to bear up chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in times of greateſt perſecution, when we are called to reſiſt unto blood, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo fiery tryals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Get a right underſtanding of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions for Chriſts and the Goſpels ſake, look upon them not with an eye of Senſe, but an eye of Faith, judge of them as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Scripture, and not as fleſh and blood repreſents them to you. For this will lay a Foundation for chearfullneſs under the foreſt perſecutions, if we have a right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. To this end conſider what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Scripture gives of perſecutions for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105607:82"/>Chriſts ſake, or which is all one, for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels ſake, or for Righteouſneſs ſake.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Perſecutions for Righteouſneſs ſake are Bleſſings, real Bleſſings, great Bleſſings, for they confirm our title to a Kingdom, a more glorious Kingdom than any is to be enjoyed in this World. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Bleſſed are they which are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> If a man conſult with fleſh and blood that will tell him, it is a miſerable thing to be under perſecution, to have our eſtates, liberties and lives taken from us, but if we conſult the Scriptures, they will tell us, that 'tis a bleſſed thing to be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that there are no men on earth more bleſſed, than they that are perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, and none are ſo happy as they that ſhall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Perſecutions for Righteouſneſs ſake are matter of joy rather than ſorrow. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. <hi>But rejoyce in as much as ye are pertakers of the ſufferings of Chriſt.</hi> Yea they are a ground of exceeding great joy, for they encreaſe our grace here, and our glory hereafter. They are a ground of great joy, as they encreaſe our grace here. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>My brethren count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations, knowing this, that the trying of your Faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth patience.</hi> The Apoſtle writes to the twelve Tribes that were ſcattered abroad, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed out of their own country, was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105607:83"/>ſome degree of perſecution, and when abroad among Heathens and Idolaters, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually liable to perſecutions for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, yet he bids them count it all joy, when they fell into divers temptations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereby their Faith ſhould be tryed, and Patience encreaſed. Perſecutions for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſake are a ground of exceeding great joy, becauſe they will encreaſe our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Heaven for ever. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for ſo perſecuted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> Obſerve here our Lord Jeſus doth not ſay to his Servants when under perſecution, be not caſt down, but rejoyce and be glad, and not only ſo, but be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, and why, becauſe perſecutions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our reward in the other World. <hi>Great is your reward in Heaven.</hi> Yea he would have us ſo exceeding joyfull as to leap for joy. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rejoyce ye in that day, and leap for joy, for behold your reward is great in Heaven.</hi> That day wherein Chriſt would have us leap for joy, is the day of perſecution, ſpoken of in the foregoing verſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Perſecutions for Chriſt are honours and favours, and ought to be eſteemed as ſuch as by all true Chriſtians. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. <hi>And they departed from the preſence of the counſel, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105607:83"/>that they were counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his name.</hi> The Apoſtles counted it an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be beaten and reproached for Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his name ſake;</hi> We ſee here, that it is a gift, a favour for a man to be called to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Perſecutions for Chriſt are not ſtrange and unuſual things, but are the common lot of Chriſtians, and are to be counted upon by all that will live Godly in Chriſt, from the firſt day we give our ſelves to Chriſt, till we lay down theſe Earthly Tabernacles. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Yea, and all that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution.</hi> Sufferings for Chriſt are to be expected from the firſt day, that we give our ſelves to Chriſt. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will come after me — let him take up his croſs.</hi> And to the laſt day of our continuance in this World, for we are liable to ſufferings as long as we continue in the body. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them that ſuffer adverſity, as being your ſelves alſo in the body.</hi> Yea we muſt not think it a ſtrange thing if we ſhould meet with fiery tryals, and be burnt for our Religion as well as others have been before us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4, 12. <hi>Beloved think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal, which is to try you, as though ſome ſtrange thing happened to you.</hi> That paſſage <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto blood</hi>— Intimateth that all Chriſtians ſhould count upon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105607:84"/>it, that though they had not hitherto, yet it may be their lot to have their blood ſhed for Chriſt. They had ſuffered deeply in their names and eſtates, and were eminent for grace, and had attained aſſurance of their Salvation. <hi>Ch.</hi> 10.32, 33, 34. Yet for all this, though God had ſpared them as to life, and they had not yet reſiſted unto blood, they knew not, but that might alſo come upon them, to lay down their lives for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The knowledge and belief of Gods infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, everlaſting and unchangable love to us in Chriſt Jeſus, and of Chriſts love in laying down his Life for us, will carry us chearfully through our greateſt perſecutions. and make us to triumph over all manner of perſecutions, even at ſuch a time as we are killed all the day long, and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter. As we may ſee it excellently ſet out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 36, 37, 38, 39, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt! ſhall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Peril, or Sword? (As it is written, for thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter) Nay in all theſe things we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded that neither death nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Let us take notice in this Scripture of theſe things.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:105607:84"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The love of Chriſt, and the love of God in Chriſt towards his people, is ſo fixed, ſo firm, ſo unchangeable, that no manner of troubles or perſecutions, no creature in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth is or ſhall be able to ſeparate them from the love of Chriſt, and the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus, that is, which is grounded upon the merits and mediation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The apprehenſion and perſwaſion of Gods love to our Souls in Chriſt Jeſus, and the immutability of this love, will help us to overcome and triumph over all manner of troubles and perſecutions. <hi>Nay in all theſe things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us, for I am perſwaded that neither death nor life—nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeperate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> In all theſe things, that is, all the forementioned tribulations and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though we be flain by the Sword, or are ſtarved to Death by Famine, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, yea more than conquerors, and how? not by our own ſtrength, but through him that loved us, and how doth he give us the victory. By giving us a firm perſwaſion of the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able love of God in Chriſt. <hi>For I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Obſerve the time and ſeaſon when the ſervants of Chriſt are made to triumph as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors over all their troubles, and that is, when it is noon day in reſpect of their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105607:85"/>when 'tis the hotteſt time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they are not only deprived of their goods, thruſt into priſons, but killed, killed all the day long, and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter. And let us ſee what is implyed in theſe expreſſions.
<list>
                        <item>(1.) It is to be all the day long in hazard and danger of death. When it is with us as it was with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſickneſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.13. So 'tis with us in reſpect of our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, we reckon in the night they may come upon us before the morning, and the morning may come before the night, and rend and tear us in pieces, or when 'tis with us as it was with <hi>David. Pſal.</hi> 119.109. <hi>My Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in my hand,</hi> then we may be ſaid to be killed all the day long.</item>
                        <item>(2.) When we are put to a lingring death, that it may be the more painfull, that we are as it were all the day long in a dying condition; this ſome perſecutors endeavoured, <hi>ut ſentiant ſe mori,</hi> then we may be ſaid to be killed all the day long.</item>
                        <item>(3.) When perſecutors make no more of killing us, than they do of killing ſheep, when the Saints are killed in abundance, that it is a time of much blood-ſhed, yea when they joy in the death of Gods Servants. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.13. They are counted as Sheep for the ſlaughter.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the knowledge and belief of the love of Chriſt, will help us to go through all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions chearfully, ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:105607:85"/>
                  <p n="1">1. As it leads to the filling our Souls with the graces and comforts of the Spirit of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. <hi>And to know the love of Christ which paſſeth knowledge, that ye may be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> The more we are filled with the graces and comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, the ſtronger we ſhall be to ſuffer for Chriſt, for the joy of the Lord is our ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it draws out our love to Chriſt. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>We have known and believed the love that God hath to us— Herein is our love made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>— And the more we love Chriſt, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we ſhall be to ſuffer for Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>Love is ſtrong as death— Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Get and keep a lively hope of eternal life and glory, for this will be a wonderfull ſupport to you in your greateſt perſecutions. This cauſed our Lord Jeſus to endure the pain, and the ſhame of the Croſs with much chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the Right hand of the Throne of God.</hi> The having the joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his thoughts cauſed him to endure the pain, and make light of the ſhame of the croſs. This cauſed the Apoſtles to glory and triumph in the midſt of their troubles. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2, 3. —<hi>And rejoyce in hope of the glory of God; And not only ſo, but we glory in Tribulations alſo.</hi> The reſpect which <hi>Moſes</hi> had to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105607:86"/>of reward in the other World, carryed him with chearfulneſs through his great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24, 25, 26. The hope of Salvation is by the Apoſtles called an helmet. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Putting on the breast-plate of Faith and Love, and for an helmet the hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The helmet preſerves the head in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as long as we keep on this helmet, as long as we keep our hope of Salvation, we are in a ſafe condition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If you would go chearfully through all your perſecutions, get and exerciſe the graces of Faith and Patience, for they are of ſingular uſe in an evil day. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7, 10. <hi>And it was given to him to make war with the Saints, and to overcome them— Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints.</hi> When the beaſt maketh war with the Saints, and overcomes them, that is, God permits him to kill and ſlay as Conquerors thoſe that they have overcome, then is a time when there is great need, great uſe of Faith and Patience. I ſhall ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to both theſe graces.
<list>
                        <item>1. Get and exerciſe Faith; Faith is the moſt uſefull, moſt neceſſary piece of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Armour in an evil day, and therefore we are called upon above all to take the ſhield of Faith, becauſe thereby we ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one; <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the ſhield of Faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery

                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Conſider the patience of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all his ſufferings, that will learn us patience in all our diſtreſſes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Let us run with patience the race that is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105607:87"/>ſet before us, looking to Jeſus — Who for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the ſhame— For conſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leaſt ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</hi> The looking to Jeſus, and conſidering the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his perſon, the greatneſs of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the patience with which he endured the pain and the ſhame of the Croſs, and the contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, will help us to run our race with Patience, and keep us from being wearied and fainting in our minds. An inſtance of the patience of Chriſt under his ſufferings, which all things conſidered, were greater than the ſufferings of any of the Martyrs; We have <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7. <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth, he is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before the ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth.</hi> And as the example of Chriſt, ſo alſo the example of the Prophets and other Saints and Servants of God, may cauſe us to be patient under our perſecutions. It hath been the lot of the beſt men that ever lived, even of the Prophets, to be perſecuted for Righteouſneſs ſake. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>So perſecuted they the Prophets. Luk.</hi> 13.34. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, which killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee. Jam.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Take my brethren the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of ſuffering affliction and patience.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the deſert of ſin. They which ſuffer moſt in this Life, ſuffer far leſs than their ſins deſerve; How great were <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions of all ſorts? yet they were leſs than his ſins. <hi>Job</hi> 11.6. <hi>Know therefore that God exacteth of thee, leſs than thine iniquity deſerveth. Ezra</hi> 9.14. compared with <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. No ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows like what the Jews met with, yet were they puniſhed leſs than their ſins deſerved.

               <p>SEeing it is thus, that an intereſt in Chriſt is a ground of ſtrong Conſolation under all the troubles of this Life, and the terrors of Death, then let all thoſe that are yet in a Chriſtleſs condition, ſeek after an intereſt in Chriſt, and thoſe that are in doubt whether they have an intereſt in Chriſt, make ſure work in this thing, that they get Chriſt for theirs, and that they become his. What <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith of Wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wiſdom, and with all thy gettings get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> That may I ſay concerning Jeſus Chriſt, who is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Wiſdom of God. Chriſt is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing, therefore get Chriſt, yea with all thy gettings, get an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt. The main, the principal thing that we have to ſeek after, that we ſhould employ our thoughts and our time in, is not how we ſhould get the World, the Riches or Honours of the World,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105607:89"/>but how we ſhould get Chriſt, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Souls by Chriſt, and therefore we ſhould be more ſollicitous to get Chriſt, than we are to get any thing in this World; we are all deſirous of comfort while we live in an evil and troubleſome World, and we are deſirous of comfort when we dye, why then are we ſo cold and remiſs, and in ſeeking after Chriſt? The ready way: yea the only way to live and dye comfortably is to get an intereſt in Chriſt, the Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For true and ſolid comfort is to be had only in and through Chriſt. To render this Exhortation more effectual I ſhall,

                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> How and in what manner we are to ſeek after an intereſt in Chriſt.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. Seek early and ſpeedily after an intereſt in Chriſt; Put not off this work one day. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, to day if ye will hear his voice.</hi> It is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105607:90"/>of the Holy Ghoſt, that we ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſeeking, embracing, obeying Chriſt one day. <hi>Hear his voice</hi>— That is, come to him, believe in him, obey him, cloſe with him. When we are in diſtreſs we would have Chriſt make haſt to help us. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 70.5. <hi>I am poor and needy, make haſt unto me, O God— O Lord make no tarrying.</hi> And ſhall not we make haſt to get unto him, and make no tarrying. We ſhould ſtir up our ſelves to ſeek early after Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.8. <hi>Awake up my glory, awake Pſaltery and Harp, I my ſelf will awake early. David</hi> here ſtirs up himſelf to an early and lively bleſſing God, ſo ſhould we to an early ſeeking Chriſt. Awake O my Soul, and all that is within me, I my ſelf will awake early, and ſeek early after Chriſt, and we ſhould ſtir up one another. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.21. To ſtir us up to an early and ſpeedy ſeeking Chriſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſaving and loſing of our immortal Souls dependeth on our having or not having Chriſt. <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life, and he that hath not the Son hath not Life.</hi> And where natural Life is concerned, we make haſt to preſerve it. When <hi>Lot</hi> was in danger of being conſumed in the flames of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he ran, he fled, he made no tarrying any where, till he was got to <hi>Zoar. Gen.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Eſcape for thy life, look not behind thee, neither ſtay thou in all the plain, eſcape to the mountain, leſt thou be conſumed.</hi> Eternal Life is of greater
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105607:90"/>concernment than natural Life, and therefore more care ſhould be taken to preſerve Eternal than Temporal Life, we ſhall be caſt into Hell flames, if we get not Chriſt before we dye, and therefore we had need run; ye flee, and not tarry any where till we are got to Chriſt. When the <hi>Shunamite</hi> went to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet on the behalf of her dead Child, ſhe made great haſt to get to him, and ſaid to her ſerve on. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Drive, and go forward, ſlack not thy pace, riding for me, except I bid thee.</hi> Thou haſt a buſineſs of greater concernment to go to Chriſt about, than this woman had to go to the Prophet, ſhe had a dead Son, and thou haſt a Soul dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and therefore make haſt, go forward, ſlack not thy pace till thou haſt gotten to Chriſt, and Chriſt hath given thee Life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The time of Life is the only time for ſeeking and getting Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt. There is no getting Chriſt, no work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out thy Salvation after thou art dead. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave whither thou goeſt.</hi> And therefore as the Nobleman ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Joh</hi> 4.49. <hi>Sir come down e're my child dye.</hi> So ſhould we ſay to God, Lord give us Chriſt, e're we dye. The time of Life being the only time for getting an intereſt in Chriſt, we had not need defer this work, no not ſo much as one day. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Ye
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105607:91"/>know not what ſhall be on the morrow, for what is your Life, it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> The ſtouteſt and ſtrongeſt men are but graſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.5. <hi>All fleſh is graſs.</hi> And what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the graſs? it is freſh in the morning, cut down and withered before night. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.6. <hi>In the morning it flouriſheth and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, in the evening it is cut down and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> The graſs is growing in the field one day, and burning in the oven the next day. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.30. <hi>The graſs to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven.</hi> Such is the condition of all fleſh, like graſs. A man may be in good health, in a flouriſhing condition in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and be dead and withered in the evening. He may be full of mirth and jollity one day, and be burning in Hell the next. Therefore defer not the ſeeking after Chriſt, and your Souls Salvation, one day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such as ſeek Chriſt early have a promiſe that they ſhall find him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me, and shoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> A promiſe that we ſhall find Chriſt is great encouragement, yea good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that our labour ſhall not be in vain; who would not ſeek a bag of Gold, if he were ſure he ſhould find it? We have a ſure word of promiſe, that if we ſeek Chriſt early we ſhall find him; And to find Chriſt is better than to find an houſe full of Gold, better than to find all the Silver and Gold in the world.</p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:105607:91"/>
                  <p n="4">4. Seeking after Chriſt and Salvation by Chriſt, is work that the great God, who is King of Kings, hath given us to do. And as <hi>David</hi> ſaid in another caſe. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.8. <hi>The Kings buſineſs required haſt.</hi> So may I ſay here; This buſineſs being the Kings buſineſs, it requireth haſt. When the Angels told the Shepherds, that Chriſt was born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that they ſhould find him wrapped in ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-cloths, and lying in a Manger, they made haſt to get a ſight of him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.16. <hi>They came with haſt — and found the babe lying in a Manger.</hi> To be made pertakers of Chriſt and all his ſaving benefits, is of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to have a ſight of Chriſt lying in the Manger, and if the Shepherds upon the invitation of an Angel, made haſt to ſee Chriſt when he was a little Babe, lying in a Manger, then how much more doth it concern us to make haſt to be pertakers of Chriſt, and all his ſaving benefits, at the call and command of the great God.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. We muſt ſeek an intereſt in Chriſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and earneſtly, not remiſly, as if we did not much care whether we got Chriſt or no. We muſt ſay to God, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did to <hi>Jacob. Gen.</hi> 30.1. <hi>Give me children or elſe I dye.</hi> VVe muſt beg for Chriſt as for Life. Lord give me Chriſt or I dye: give me Chriſt or I am undone for ever. The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us to covet earneſtly the beſt gifts. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:105607:92"/>12.31. <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts.</hi> Chriſt is the beſt of all the gifts that ever God gave to any of the Children of men, and therefore we ſhould covet earneſtly the giving of Jeſus Chriſt to our Souls. They that labour in a hot and ſcorching day, do earneſtly deſire to get into the ſhadow. <hi>Job.</hi> 7.2. <hi>The Servant earneſtly deſireth the ſhadow.</hi> There is a hot and ſcorching day approaching. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Behold the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven.</hi> Earneſtly deſire to get under Chriſts ſhadow before this ſcorching day, and hot day comes. To be under Chriſts ſhadow is more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and refreſhing in the hotteſt day of Gods vengeance, under the moſt ſcorching perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than it is to a labouring man to ſet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhadow in the hotteſt day, and in the hotteſt climate of the world. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. <hi>I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight.</hi> VVicked men are very earneſt and diligent in following after their ſins. <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.3. <hi>They do evil with both hands earneſtly.</hi> And ſhall not we be more earneſt to get Chriſt, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Souls, than wicked men are to commit ſin, and bring damnation upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? This is a ſure way to find Chriſt, to ſeek him diligently. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. <hi>And ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your hearts. Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> And what is the reward that God giveth to them that ſeek him diligently? He gives them himſelf
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105607:92"/>for their reward. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. VVe muſt ſeek after Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt above all things in this world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs</hi> — Firſt, that is, mainly, chiefly, make it your main care, your chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt buſineſs to get to Heaven. The Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> deſire and endeavour above all things was, that he might win Chriſt, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do or ſuffer any thing, ſo that he might win Chriſt, and be found in him at the great day of judgment. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>For whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all things that are in this VVorld; what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of wiſdom. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Wiſdom is better than Rubies, and all the things that may be deſired are not to be compared with her</hi> The ſame is true of Chriſt, the wiſdom of God. Chriſt is better than Rubies, and all things, that we can deſire, are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with him, and therefore to ſeek to get Chriſt above all things in the world. VVith what eagerneſs do ſome men ſeek after the world, they riſe early, they ſet up late, there is no end of all their labour, and they never think that they have enough of the world. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He hath neither child nor brother,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105607:93"/>yet there is no end of all his labour, neither is eye ſatisfied with riches.</hi> And ſome men that are not willing to take much pains, are exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous of the world. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.25, 26, <hi>His hands refuſe to labour, he coveteth greedily all the day long.</hi> Oh that men would but take the like pains to get Chriſt, that they do to get the world, that they would covet Chriſt greedily all the day long, that there were no end of their labour, that they would never ſay they have enough of Chriſt, but labour to get more and more of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We muſt ſeek Chriſt conſtantly, we muſt ſeek him till we have found him, and got poſſeſſion of him. If we looſe a piece of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we look diligently for it, and we look till we find it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.8. <hi>What woman having ten pieces of Silver, if ſhe looſe one piece, doth not light a candle, and ſweep the houſe, and ſeek diligently till he find it.</hi> If there be ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſeek a little piece of Silver, that we will not give over looking and ſeeking till we have found it, how much more ſhould we ſeek after Chriſt, till we have found him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is better than all the Silver and Gold in the world. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.4. <hi>Seek the Lord and his ſtrength, ſeek his face evermore.</hi> We muſt not only ſeek the Lord for a time, or for a long time, but for evermore. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.12. <hi>It is time to ſeek the Lord, till he come and rain Righteouſneſs upon you.</hi> Though it ſhould be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105607:93"/>very long before the Lord comes, yet we muſt ſeek him till he come. Now if we would continue ſeeking after an intereſt in Chriſt, till we have obtained it, we muſt take heed of theſe two things.
<list>
                        <item>1. Of reſting ſatisfied in any condition, in any gifts, in any enjoyments, till God hath given us Jeſus Chriſt. What <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid concerning his being childleſs. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Lord God what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go childleſs.</hi> So ſhould we ſay concerning a Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs condition. <hi>Lord God, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing I go Chriſtleſs.</hi> None of all Gods gifts ſhould ſatisfie us, unleſs he hath given us Chriſt. Though he hath given us excellent gifts and parts, though he hath given us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable yoak-fellows, convenient habitations, plentifull eſtates, beneficial callings, yet none of theſe nor any other gifts, can make up the want of Chriſt, and therefore we ſhould ſay, what wilt thou give me, ſeeing go Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. VVhat is ſaid of <hi>Booz</hi> in reference to <hi>Ruth. Ruth.</hi> 3.18. <hi>The man will not be in reſt, untill he have finiſhed the thing this day.</hi> The like ſhould we do in reference to ſeeking an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, we ſhould not be at reſt in our minds, till we have finiſhed this thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the getting a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. VVe muſt take heed of giving over ſeeking after Chriſt through diſcouragement. To ſuch as are ready to give over ſeeking after Chriſt; I ſhall give theſe two encouragements,

Though you do not find him for the preſent, yet you ſhall find him in a little while, in his own due time. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3, 1, 4. <hi>By night on my bed, I ſought him whom my Soul loveth, and I found him not— It was but a little — and I found him whom my Soul loveth.

                     <head>§ Motives to get a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt.</head>
                     <p>Moſt perſons that live under the Goſpel, make light of Chriſt, and neglect that great
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105607:94"/>Salvation which he hath purchaſed with his blood, and prefer their worldly concernments before ſeeking after Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. <hi>They made light of it, and went their way, one to his farm, another to his Merchandize.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt offers Salvation to loſt ſinners, he doth as it were ſtretch out his hands to them, and offer them his help to ſave their Souls, but ſcarce any man regards the offers of grace and mercy, that he makes to them. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I have stretched out my hand, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</hi> This ſtretching forth the hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the offers of Salvation, that Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the Goſpel, to periſhing Sinners. When <hi>Peter</hi> was in a boyſterous Sea, and was afraid of being drowned, and began to ſink, he cryed out to Chriſt, <hi>Lord ſave me! And immediately Jeſus ſtretched forth his hand and caught him. Mat.</hi> 14.30, 31. Chriſtleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are in a more dangerous condition than <hi>Peter</hi> was, they are ready to ſink down into Hell, ſentence is paſſed upon them by the great God. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell Pſal.</hi> 9.17. And Chriſt ſtretcheth forth his hand, and offers to ſave them, but moſt men are ſo ſtupified in their ſins, and ſo buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this preſent world, that they regard not the offers of Salvation made to them by Jeſus Chriſt; And therefore there is need of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſtir men up to ſeek after an intereſt in Chriſt, and to embrace that Salvation which is offered to them by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:105607:95"/>
                     <p n="1">1. Motive, The excellency of Chriſt ſhould ſtir us up to get an intereſt in him; For we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet things that are excellent, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo excellent as Jeſus Chriſt. All the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things in the world, are but loſs and droſs and dung, compared with Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> Silver and Gold, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Precious Stones, and whatever a man can deſire, are not worthy to be compared with Chriſt. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.11. <hi>For Wiſdom is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Rubies, and all things that may be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are not to be compared to it.</hi> And as Chriſt is more excellent than all things, ſo than all perſons in the world. The wiſeſt, the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the beſt, the greateſt men that ever lived are not worthy to be compared with Chriſt. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>My Beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt among Ten Thouſand.</hi> White and Red well mixed make a beautiful countenance, white may ſignifie the holineſs of his Life, ruddy his bloody paſſion; His holy life and his bloody death, render him amiable to his people. If Ten Thouſand of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſons that ever lived, were ſet by Chriſt, he would be the chiefeſt of them all. Among all the Angels of Heaven, and all the Kings of the Earth, there are none to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.6.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105607:95"/>
                        <hi>Who in Heaven can be compared unto the Lord, who among the Sons of the Mighty, can be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto the Lord.</hi> There are all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Godhead in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> And the excellencies that are in the Godhead are unſpeakable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. Seeing then there is a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in Chriſt than in all the whole world, we ſhould labour more to get Chriſt, than we did to get any thing in this world.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Get Chriſt for yours, and you ſhall get unſearchable Riches; For there are unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Riches in Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. — <hi>That I ſhould preach among you, the unſearchable Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle had ſtudied, preached, and enjoyed Chriſt many years, and yet could not expreſs or underſtand all the Riches that were treaſured up in Chriſt, but calls his Riches unſearchable Riches. By theſe Riches of Chriſt, which he calls unſearchable, underſtand thoſe benefits we have by Chriſt. As <hi>Vatablus</hi> and others, <hi>immenſa Chriſti bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitia,</hi> the incomprehenſible benefits of Chriſt. And though we can't ſearch out all the Riches that are in Chriſt, and that we have by Chriſt, though we cannot fully comprehend in this life, all the benefits we have by Chriſt, I will briefly inſtance in ſome of theſe unſpeakable benefits, which we ſhall get, if we get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt.

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The ſuitableneſs of Chriſt to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wants and deſires of our Souls ſhould ſtir us up to ſeek after him, Jeſus Chriſt is every way ſuitable to thy Souls condition, all that thy Soul wanteth, all that thy Soul doth or can deſire is to be had in Chriſt. Art thou blind and ignorant, doſt thou want ſaving knowledge? Jeſus Chriſt is the light of the World. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the World; He that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of Life.</hi> He can open blind eyes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6, 7. <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes.</hi> Chriſt can help not only dim eyes that ſee but little, but blind eyes that can ſee nothing at all. Art thou under the ſenſe of guilt, do thy ſins lye heavy upon thy Conſcience? becauſe of the multitude of them, or their heinous nature, as being committed againſt much light, great mercies, and other aggravating circumſtances? Chriſts blood is available for taking away all thy ſins, though thou beeſt one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſinners in the whole world. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> The blood of Chriſt waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105607:97"/>away <hi>Noahs</hi> Drunkenneſs, <hi>Lots</hi> Inceſt, <hi>Davids</hi> Murder and Adultery, <hi>Peters</hi> denyal of Chriſt, and his Perjury, <hi>Pauls</hi> Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Perſecutions. Doſt thou feel the plague of thy heart, and groan under the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of thy nature, and find a great want of the Sanctifying grace of God? Chriſt is made of God unto us Sanctification. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30 <hi>Of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us — Sanctification.</hi> He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a bloody death to purchaſe Sanctifying grace for us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Jeſus that he might ſanctifie the people with his own blood, ſuffered without the gate.</hi> Art thou held in the cords of thy ſins? canſt thou not repent off, and forſake thy ſins? Jeſus Chriſt was ſent to preach deliverance to the captives <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. And exalted to give Repentance. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance and Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins unto Iſrael.</hi> And was ſent to bleſs us, in turning us from our iniquities. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.26. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning you away, every one from his iniquities.</hi> Is thy heart dead, doſt thou want Spiritual Life? There is Life to be had in Chriſt, for ſuch as have dead hearts, yea for ſuch as are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the Reſurrection and the Life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet he ſhall live.</hi> Art thou in a loſt undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105607:98"/>Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour of loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</hi> Art thou in a mourning condition, full of grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, either becauſe of thy afflictions, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſins? Jeſus Chriſt was ſent to comfort all that mourn in <hi>Zion, Iſa.</hi> 61.3. Not to inſtance in more particulars, whatever it is that thou wanteſt, there is a rich ſupply of all thy needs, be thy needs never ſo many or great, to be had in and by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his Riches, in glory by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Whatſoever it is which thy Soul doth or can deſire to have, there is a full ſupply of all thy deſires to be had in Chriſt and from Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.19. <hi>He will fulfill the deſire of them that fear him.</hi> There is ſo much vanity and vexation in worldly things, that it is an hard matter to find any good. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Many ſay, who will ſhew us any good?</hi> But in Chriſt we ſhall find all good, all that good which we want, all that good which we deſire to have. And ſhall not this ſtir us up to ſeek after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is not only a matter of expediency or conveniency that we get an intereſt in Chriſt, but it is of abſolute neceſſity, ſo that we are undone for ever, if we do not get an intereſt in Chriſt. We can't live comfortably with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, we can't dye in peace without
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105607:98"/>Chriſt, we can't appear at the great day of judgment without Chriſt, we can't be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Heaven without Chriſt. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God hath not Life.</hi> We can't have the pardon of one ſin, without the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion.</hi> And no other blood will procure remiſſion of ſins, but the blood of Chriſt. The abſolute neceſſity of getting an intereſt in Chriſt, will appear from the wofull and miſerable condition of all thofe that are without Chriſt, which ſhall be ſet forth in the next head.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. To ſtir us up to ſeek after a ſaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt; Let us conſider the wofull and miſerable condition of all ſuch as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt. To this purpoſe, weigh theſe following Scriptures. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That at the time ye were without Chriſt, being Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael, and strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> Here is a fourfold deſcription of the miſery of ſuch as are without Chriſt.
<list>
                           <item>1. They are <hi>Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael;</hi> That is, they are none of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, they have no right too, no part or portion in any of the priviledges belonging to the people of God.</item>
                           <item>2. They are <hi>ſtrangers to the covenants of promiſe,</hi> or to the promiſes of the covenant.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105607:99"/>There are many promiſes in the covenant, as I will be your God, I will be mercifull to their Unrighteouſneſs, and remember their ſins and iniquities no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they that are without Chriſt are ſtrangers to the covenant, and all the promiſes of the covenant, they have no right too, no part in the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</item>
                           <item>3. They are <hi>without hope.</hi> They have much preſumption, but they are without hope, they have no hope of the pardon of their ſins, they have no hope of the Salvation of their Souls, they have no hope of the mercy of God in this life or the life to come.</item>
                           <item>4. They are <hi>without God.</hi> That is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the favour of God, without the bleſſing of God, without communion with God, and a man without God is a man without all good. Here is much comprehended in few words, concerning the miſery of a man that is without Chriſt. He is without God, without Hope, without a Promiſe, without any part in the priviledges belonging to the people of God. They that are without Chriſt, ſhall be ſhut out of the Kingdom of Heaven for ever. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God hath not Life.</hi> They that are without Chriſt, ſhall be caſt into the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>The unbelieving ſhall have their part in the Lake, which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. To get an intereſt in Chriſt is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and chiefeſt buſineſs we have to do in this World; This was hinted before, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and with all thy gettings get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> This is moſt true of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the wiſdom of God. Chriſt is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal thing, and therefore with all our gettings, we ſhould endeavour to get Jeſus Chriſt. It is of greater concernment to get Chriſt than to get Riches; It is of greater concernment to get Chriſt than to get peace and comfort; It is of greater concernment to get Chriſt than to get power againſt ſome particular corruption, greater than to get ſome particular grace, or than to get freedom from ſome vexatious temptation. I ſhall ſpeak diſtinctly to theſe heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is off far greater concernment to get Chriſt, than to get Riches, and that on ſeveral accounts.
<list>
                           <item>(1.) A man may have great Riches, and yet be a miſerable man. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for the miſeries that ſhall come upon you.</hi> But whoſoever getteth Chriſt, getteth true bleſſedneſs, and is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy man. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.12. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, bleſſed is that man that truſteth in thee.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>(2.) Riches will be no advantage to a man in an evil day; They will not ſave a man from the Sword or Peſtilence, or other judgments. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Riches profit not in a day of wrath.</hi>
                              <pb n="188" facs="tcp:105607:100"/>But Jeſus Chriſt is every way profitable in a day of wrath: For he will reconcile us to God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf</hi>— And he will be an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the ſtorm. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2.</item>
                           <item>(3) A man may be a rich man, and yet go to Hell when he dyeth. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22, 23. <hi>The rich man dyed and was buried in hell, he lift up his eyes being in torments</hi>— But there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</item>
                           <item>(4.) Though a man get much Riches, he muſt leave them all behind him when he dyeth. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. <hi>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</hi> But ſuch as get Chriſt ſhall enjoy Chriſt to Eternity.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is of far greater concernment to get Chriſt, than to get peace and comfort. Some perſons that are under trouble of mind, and diſtreſs of Conſcience, make it their only care and great buſineſs to get comfort, they would do any thing to be at reſt and peace. But though perſons under a troubled Spirit, may Lawfully ſeek for comfort, yet it muſt not be their only or their chiefeſt care to ſeek for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but their main endeavour ſhould be to get Chriſt. We ſhould ſeek for Chriſt more than comfort. For
<list>
                           <item>(1.) There is no way to get true peace and comfort, but in and by Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105607:100"/>
                              <hi>That in me ye might have peace. Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come to me all ye that labour and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will give you reſt.</hi> We may ſeek and labour to find reſt for our Souls, but we ſhall find none, unleſs we go to Chriſt for it.</item>
                           <item>2. Chriſt is more neceſſary than comfort, for if we could get comfort without Chriſt, thoſe comforts would end in ſorrow, and we ſhould be miſerable for ever. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. <hi>Behold all ye that kindle a fire, that compaſs your ſelves about with ſparks, walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that ye have kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, this ſhall ye have at mine hand, ye ſhall lye down in ſorrow.</hi> But if we get Chriſt, though we ſhould walk in darkneſs and in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all our days, we ſhall be happy for ever and ever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>Yea happy is that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                     </p>

For a due ſence of our ſin and miſery will make us haſten to Chriſt, and cauſe us with all thankfulneſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Salvation that he hath purchaſed for us. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.25. <hi>His Diſciples came to him, and awoke him, ſaying, Maſter ſave us, we pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> If we ſaw our ſelves in a periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we ſhould be as forward and as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to go to Chriſt to ſave us, as his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were, when they were in danger to be drowned. To be in danger of damnation is a greater awakening to a man, then to be in danger of drowning. For Hell is a worſe place than the Sea; A man that is drowned in the Sea is quickly dead, their pain is ſoon over, but ſuch as go to Hell are in everlaſting burnings. And if the Diſciples haſtned to Chriſt to ſave them, when they were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be drowned, how will poor diſtreſſed ſinners haſten to Chriſt to ſave them, when they ſee themſelves in danger of being damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17, 18, 19. <hi>I periſh with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I will ariſe and go to my father, and will ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> When the prodigal Son ſaw his ſins, and ſaw himſelf in a periſhing condition, then he haſtned to his Father, confeſſeth and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſin, judgeth himſelf unworthy to be owned by his Father, and was willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105607:103"/>of mercy on any terms, ſo he might be admitted into his Fathers family, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſubmit to any thing, though it were to be the meaneſt ſervant in his fathers houſe, and to do the hardeſt work his father had for him to do. And as the ſenſe of a periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo alſo a due ſight of our ſins, will make us willing to accept of mercy on any terms, willing to ſubmit to any thing, ſo we may be delivered from eternal death. <hi>Job.</hi> 7.20. <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, O thou preſerver of men?</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of ſin, he was willing to ſubmit to any thing that God ſhould require of him, to get his ſins pardoned. As it was with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they were under the ſenſe of their ſin, and felt their miſery by the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their enemies, they were willing God ſhould do what he would with them, ſo that he would deliver them from the <hi>Philiſtines. Judg.</hi> 10.15. <hi>The children of Iſrael ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, we have ſinned, do thou unto us whatſoever ſeemeth good unto thee, deliver us only we pray thee this day.</hi> So it will be with us, when we have a through ſight of our ſins, we ſhall be glad of mercy on any terms, we ſhall be willing that God ſhall do to us what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeemeth good in his ſight, ſo he will deliver us from wrath to come, and will not caſt us into Hell for our ſins. Now there are but few men, even of ſuch as live under the means of grace, and hear the word of God
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105607:103"/>often preached to them, that have a through ſight and ſenſe of their ſin and miſery.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105607:104"/>wicked, who can know it.</hi> The heart is not only wicked, but deſperately wicked, ſo deſperately wicked that it is above our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to know or conceive all that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that is in our hearts. The heart is as full of evil as it can hold, yea of the worſt ſorts of ſins, that if God ſhould let a man alone, he would carry himſelf like a mad man, regarding neither the Laws of God nor men. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9, 3. <hi>The heart of the Sons of men is full of evil, yea madneſs is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</hi> What worſe ſin then enmity againſt God, and his holy Laws and Commandments? yet this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God is in the hearts of all men, till God circumciſeth our hearts to love and obey him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> The heart is ſo vile and ſinfull that it is continually ſinning againſt God, either by evil deſires, or evil thoughts and imaginations. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>And God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> It is enough to amaze a man, when he heareth what God (who knoweth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of our hearts, better than we our ſelves) ſaith of the ſinfulneſs of our hearts; we may wonder that he lets us live upon the earth, and doth not ſend us down to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in Hell. Oh what need have we of Chriſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105607:104"/>to mediate for us, and take away our ſins.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the ſinfulneſs of our hearts, let us hear what the Scripture ſaith of the ſinfulneſs of our lives and converſations. While a man remains in a Chriſtleſs condition, every thing that a man doth is defiled with ſin. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>If one that is unclean by a dead body, touch any of theſe, ſhall it be unclean? and the Prieſt anſwered and ſaid, it ſhall be unclean. Then anſwered Haggai and ſaid, ſo is this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo is this nation before me ſaith the Lord, and ſo is every work of their hands, and that which they offer there is unclean.</hi> An unclean ſinner defileth every thing he hath to do with, every work of his hands is unclean, and that which he offers to God is unclean. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin.</hi> The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> not only all men, but all things of all men, all their thoughts, words and actions, all are concluded under ſin, that is, God in the holy Scriptures declareth, all men and all things of all men, before they come to Chriſt to be ſinful. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their Mind and Conſcience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi> If one ſin caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, if one ſin caſt the Angels out of Heaven, and of Angels made them Divels, what a woful condition are they in, that have done nothing elſe ſince they were born, and can do nothing elſe but ſin againſt God. When we conſider our ſinful and polluted eſtate, we may ſet
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105607:105"/>down, and bemoan our ſelves, and ſay as <hi>Job, Behold I am vile. Job</hi> 40.4. And to loath and abhor our ſelves in our own ſight, and in the ſight of the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hear and apply to thy ſelf what the Scripture ſaith concerning the miſery of all thoſe that are in a Chriſtleſs condition. As</p>
                     <p n="1">1. They are under the wrath and curſe of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>And were by nature the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, even as others.</hi> All men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one as well as another, are the children of wrath. And as long as they abide in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, unbelieving Chriſtleſs condition, they abide under the wrath of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Now this is a moſt dreadful condition to be under the wrath of God. The wrath of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King is as a meſſenger of death. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14. And a meſſenger of death will ſet a man weeping ſorely. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.1, 2. <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> wept ſore, when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> came with a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of death to him. It is like the roaring of a Lion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.12. And when the Lion roars, all the beaſts of the Forreſts tremble. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.8. <hi>The Lion hath roared, who will not fear.</hi> If the wrath of an earthly King be ſo dreadfull, how dreadfull is the wrath of the great God, who is King of Kings. Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is unconceivable, we cannot underſtand the power and dreadfull effects of his wrath. <hi>Pſal.</hi>

They are under a ſentence of eternal condemnation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>By the offence of one man, judgment came upon all men to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> And this ſentence of condemnation abideth upon a man as long as he abideth in unbelief. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> Now eternal condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is far more dreadfull than any troubles that any man ever met with in this world. <hi>Job.</hi> 10.1, 2. When <hi>Job</hi> was in great bitterneſs of Spirit, and was weary of his Life, he dreaded condemnation more than all his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. I am weary of my Life— <hi>I will ſpeak in the bitterneſs of my Soul, I will ſay unto God, do not condemn me.</hi> The thoughts and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of eternal miſery, make the hardeſt hearted ſinners in the world to fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Of all ſinners, ſuch as live under, and reſiſt the means of grace, are the hardeſt heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners, and ſuch as make a profeſſion of Religion, and are but Hypocrites have very hard hearts and ſeared Conſciences, yet the ſinners in <hi>Zion,</hi> and the hypocrites tremble at the thoughts of everlaſting burnings. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath ſurprized the hypocrites, who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire, who amongſt us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Underſtand and believe that there is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

Luk.</hi> 19.10. <hi>The ſon of man is come to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt. Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> There is help in Chriſt, not only for ſuch as have hurt themſelves, for ſuch as have wounded, ſorely wounded themſelves, but for ſuch as have deſtroyed them, yea though they be <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> which is an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſin and miſery, for its worſe for an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> then for a <hi>Moabite</hi> or an <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> to deſtroy himſelf. Here is the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of miſery, deſtruction, and the height of ſin, which is for a man to be the Author of his own deſtruction, yet there is help in Chriſt for ſuch as are undone, deſtroyed, and have been the Authors of their own deſtruction. <hi>O Iſrael thou baſt destroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help.</hi> And as our Lord Jeſus came into the world purpoſely to ſave loſt and undone ſinners, ſo he is able to ſave perfectly, thoſe that come to him, and unto God by him, from all their ſins, and all their miſery. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:105607:106"/>that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as there is Salvation to be had in Chriſt for loſt and periſhing ſinners, ſo this Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to be had no where elſe, and by no other way or means whatſoever, but by Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is their Salvation in any other, for there is none other name under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, given among men, whereby we muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vtd. Iſa.</hi> 43.11. <hi>I even I am the Lord, and beſides me there is no Saviour.</hi> We are not able to ſave our ſelves, neither can all the men on earth, or all the Angels of heaven ſave us. We cannot ſave our ſelves by any ways or devices of our own, or by any works or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we can perform; if we could any way ſave our ſelves, it muſt be either by flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, and hiding our ſelves where God ſhould not find us out, but that is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for God filleth Heaven and Earth, and is preſent in all places, ſo that a man cannot flee from God, or hide himſelf where God ſhould not find him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret places that I ſhall not ſee him ſaith the Lord? Do not I fill heaven and earth ſaith the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit, or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence?

Neither of theſe can be

If a man would give all that he hath in the world to purchaſe the love of God, and the pardon of his ſins, and the Salvation of his Soul, it would be deſpiſed and contemned. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. <hi>If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utterly be contemned.

                           <item>(1.) God requires nothing of us, in order to our being partakers of Chriſt, and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits, but what he himſelf will work in us, and beſtow on us, if we ſeek to him. He requires of all that will be ſaved by Chriſt that they believe in him, but this Faith is not of our ſelves, but is given to us by God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through Faith,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105607:114"/>and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> He requireth Repentance of all thoſe that will be ſaved by Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3. But this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance he himſelf will out of his free grace give unto us, if we ſeek to him for it <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. and 11.18. He requireth of all that will be ſaved that they obey Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. But of his free grace he hath promiſed, that if we will ſeek to him, he will put his Spirit within us, and cauſe us to walk in his ways. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 37. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that we take up the Croſs, but out of his free grace he gives us to be willing and able to ſuffer for Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us that we endure to the end, and perſevere in Faith and Obedience if we would be ſaved. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.13. But he promiſeth out of his free grace to give us perſeverance, by putting his fear into our hearts, that we ſhall not depart from him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.46. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth nothing of us, but what he himſelf will work in us and for us, if we ſeek to him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Lord thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou alſo haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi>

                           <item>(2.) Theſe things that God requireth of us, as terms on which he will give us Chriſt and his ſaving benefits, are not required as was hinted before, by way of merit, to make us worthy of Chriſt, but as ways and means by which the Lord conveys the ſaving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Chriſt to our Souls, and makes us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being partakers of Chriſt. As a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105607:114"/>man that offers one an handfull of Gold, to one whoſe hands are full of Duſt, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he will let go the Dirt that is in his hands, without he let it go he can't receive the Gold. Or as a man that offers a Beggar a new gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on condition he will put off his old rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged garment and put on his new one.</item>
                           <item>(3.) Thoſe things which I call terms of Salvation, as Faith, Repentance, Suffering for Chriſt, Perſeverance, are all of them benefits and bleſſings purchaſed by Chriſt, as we may ſee if we conſult theſe Scriptures. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. We obtain Faith through Righteouſneſs of God our Saviour. Repentance is a gift we have by Chriſt. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. And ſuffering grace is purchaſed by Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. And are all given to the Elect for Chriſts ſake, with the ſame free and rich grace as Chriſt was given for us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</item>
                           <item>(4.) The Salvation of a ſinner is infinite Mercy, and infinite Grace, on whatever terms he is ſaved. For the torments of Hell, from which he is ſaved, are unſpeakable and eternal torments, and the glory of Heaven, which they ſhall have that are ſaved, is unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able glory, and that God againſt whom we have ſinned is an infinite God, and therefore it is infinite mercy and grace in him, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſave a ſinner, on whatever terms he be ſaved.</item>

                        <item>1. The conſent of our wills to have Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt, on the terms on which God offers him to us in the Goſpel.</item>
                        <item>2. A relyance on Chriſt, and truſting in Chriſt for all his ſaving benefits. By our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to have Chriſt, as God offers him to us, and our truſting in him, he becomes ours and we become his; Chriſt is the gift of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. And what makes a gift ours, but an offer on his part that hath power to diſpoſe of the gift, and acceptance on his part to whom the gift is offered, on the conditions on which it is tendered to him. All that receive or accept Chriſt on the terms on which God offers him, have upon their receiving Chriſt this priviledge conferred upon them, to be the children of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> As the <hi>Shechemites</hi> by conſenting to the terms of Union and Commerce, ſhould have become one people with the houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and greatly enriched themſelves, if the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> had dealt truly with them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.22, 23. <hi>Onely herein will the men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us, for to dwell with us, to be one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if every male among us be circumoiſed, as they are circumciſed. Shall not their cattel, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105607:115"/>their ſubſtance, and every beaſt of theirs be ours? Onely let us conſent to them, and they will dwell with us.</hi> So upon our conſenting to have Chriſt as God offers him to us, we ſhall have Union and Communion with Chriſt. We ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with Chriſt, and he will dwell with us, and his blood ſhall be ours, to waſh away our ſins, and every benefit that he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his blood ſhall be ours, only let us conſent to have him as God offers him to us in the Goſpel. There may be a treaty about Marriage, a propoſal of terms, a woing a long time, but 'tis a mutual conſenting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging each to other, that makes the Marriage Union; So it is in our Union with Chriſt, there may be frequent offers, an earneſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but it is conſenting that makes the match between us and Chriſt. When we conſent to accept of him, he will beſtow himſelf and all his benefits upon us. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Chriſt ſtanding at the door and knocking, ſignifieth the offers of grace that he makes to us in the Goſpel. He offereth himſelf to us to be our Saviour, to ſave us from eternal miſery, and is very earneſt with us to receive and embrace him, when we accept of him for our Lord and Saviour, and conſent to the terms on which he offers Salvation to us, then we hear his voice, and open the door, and then he will beſtow

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> No, all men are not willing to have Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt, on the terms of the Goſpel. There are very few that are willing to receive Chriſt on the terms of the Goſpel; Moſt men either neglect or reject him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3. <hi>He is deſpiſed and rejected of men.</hi> They are ſo few that regard the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of grace in the Goſpel, that they ſeem as none at all, compared to the multitude of thoſe that neglect and reject thee. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded.</hi> Even among thoſe that profeſs themſelves the people of God, and are accounted Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there are many that will not accept of Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice; Iſrael would none of me.</hi> It had not been ſuch matter of admiration, to have heard the Lord ſay, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> would none of me, or <hi>Egypt</hi> would none of me, but here this charge brought in againſt <hi>Iſrael: Iſrael</hi> would none of me, that may ſtartle us, and make us look well to our ſelves, that we be not found guilty of rejecting Chriſt as well as <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Moſt men are ſo wedded to the world, and to their luſts and own evil ways,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105607:116"/>that though Chriſt offer them all the joys of Heaven, if they will accept him for their Lord and Saviour, yet they will not come to him, though thereby they might have eternal life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>And ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi> And though moſt men would be willing to be ſaved by Chriſt when they dye, if they might have Salvation in their own way, namely, if they might live in their envy, enjoy their hearts luſts, and be ſaved from hell torments when they dye, yet they are not willing to accept of Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt, in his way, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his terms; They are unwilling to have him for their Lord to rule over them: They ſay in their hearts, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14. <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us.</hi> They are unwilling to forſake their ſins, and turn from their evil ways, though thereby through Chriſt they might eſcape Eternal Death, and obtain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. I ſhall therefore add ſome motives to accept of Chriſt, upon the terms offered in the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt, is worthy of all acceptation upon any terms whatſoever. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> This Salvation is worthy of all acceptation, that is, to be accepted by all men, with all readineſs of mind yea with all thankfulneſs, without objecting againſt the terms on which
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105607:117"/>this Salvation is offered to us. How readily would a blind man accept of his ſight, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man accept of a pardon, a poor man accept of riches, a dying man accept of life? Chriſt is all theſe and more, and yet ſhall we be unwilling to accept of Chriſt? If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, he will open our blind eyes, he will give unſearchable riches to thoſe that are poor, a pardon to them that are condemned, life to them that are in a dying condition, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to them that are loſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Lord thinks nothing to much, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to great, nothing to good to give to, and do for thoſe that accept of his Son. If we will accept of his Son for our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, he will give us himſelf for our God and Father, and will beſtow this wonderfull pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge upon us to be his Sons. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> And what a great, what an amazing priviledge is this, that ſuch poor, ſuch worthleſs creatures, ſuch ſinfull creatures as we are ſhould be called the Sons of God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sons of God?</hi> If we accept of his Son for our Lord and Saviour, he will beſtow his Kingdom upon us. Our Lord Jeſus ſpeaking to his little Flock that did accept him for their Shepherd, and yield up themſelves to be led, ruled and governed by him, tells them it was
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105607:117"/>their Fathers good pleaſure to give them his Kingdom. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Fear not little Flock, it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> And what a great, unexpreſſible, unconceivable gift is this, that God ſhould give us his Kingdom; What greater, what bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things hath God to give, than to give us Himſelf for our God, and his Kingdom for our Inheritance? If we will accept of Chriſt for our Lord and Saviour, the Lord will with him give us all good things freely. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give us all things.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22, 23. <hi>All things are yours — all are yours, and ye are Chriſts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is nothing in Chriſt but what is deſireable, and worthy of all acceptation. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. <hi>He is altogether lovely.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaith of every creature; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with Thanks giving.</hi> I may ſay of Chriſt: Every thing of Chriſt is good, and nothing to be refuſed, but Chriſt, and all that belongs to Chriſt, is to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Thankſgiving. That which moſt men ſtumble at in Chriſt, is his Croſs, they hear that if any man will live Godly in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, he muſt ſuffer Perſecution, but if we rightly underſtood the advantages of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Chriſt, we ſhould eſteem the Croſs of Chriſt above all the treaſures of the richeſt
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105607:118"/>Kingdom in the World. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26. As ſhall be ſhewen more fully afterward.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The terms on which Jeſus Chriſt with all his ſaving benefits is offered to us, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, beneficial, advantagious terms, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thou thy ſelf couldſt have made for thy ſelf, if God had left it to thine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, better than all the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven could have made for thee. All the terms propoſed by God, on performance whereof we ſhall enjoy Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt for ever, are real and eminent benefits, and have a ſingular worth and excellency in them, as may appear if we conſider all the terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to our enjoyment of Salvation by Chriſt.

We ſhould joyn our ſelves to Chriſt by covenant, and this covenant ſhould be an everlaſting covenant. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Come and let us joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant, that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> We ſhould engage our ſelves to Chriſt to be wholly his; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.18. <hi>And they entered into a Covenant to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers, with all their heart, and with all their ſoul.</hi> And to be only his. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5. <hi>My Soul wait thou only upon God— Mat.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> This engaging our ſelves to Chriſt by covenant is very acceptable to God, and beneficial to our ſelves. It is ſo acceptable to God that it is a means of turning away his wrath, when his anger is kindled againſt us. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.10. <hi>Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Iſrael, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</hi> And it is very beneficial to our ſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways, I will inſtance only in two.

                  <p>I ſhall in the next place mention ſeveral Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances which keep men from being made partakers of Chriſt, and his ſaving benefits, and endeavour the removal of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Hinderance. Ignorance is a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to moſt men, that keeps them from getting a ſaving intereſt in Chriſt. They are ignorant of the worth and excellency of Chriſt, and their own want of him, and ſo do not ſeek after him. And they are ignorant of Gods willingneſs to beſtow Chriſt upon them, and they are ignorant of the way and means whereby they ſhould come to enjoy and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to an intereſt in Chriſt. There is a great deal of ignorance in many people that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plentifull means of Grace; The <hi>Jews</hi> had <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, and Prieſts in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to teach and inſtruct them, yet the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105607:123"/>of them were very ignorant of the things of God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>My people is fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, they have not known me, they are ſottiſh chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they have none underſtanding, they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</hi> See how the Prophet multiplyeth expreſſions to ſet out the ignorance of the <hi>Jews.</hi> He ſaith they were fooliſh, ſottiſh, had no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, did not know God, had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to do good. And as people that have great means of knowledge may be very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſo alſo are many that take upon them to be teachers of others. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.8. <hi>The Prieſts ſaid not where is the Lord? and they that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Law know me not.</hi> And that ignorance is a great hinderance to our ſeeking after and obtaining Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt, we may ſee from ſuch Scriptures as theſe. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. Eph.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their mind. Rom.</hi> 10.3. If any ſay, what ſhould we do to get this ignorance removed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Search the Scriptures, read them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and meditate on what you read, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you ſhall come to the knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures— They are they which testifie of me.</hi> The Scriptures ſet
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:105607:124"/>out the excellency of Chriſt, and ſhew us that all things are but droſs and dung in compariſon of Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. They ſet forth our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and undone condition without Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. They ſet forth Gods willingneſs to beſtow Chriſt freely, on every one that is willing to have him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. They ſhew how, and by what means we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, which is through Faith. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. By ſearching the Scriptures we ſhall be made wiſe to Salvation. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And that from a child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation, through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If we do ſearch the Scriptures dayly, and meditate on what we read, we ſhall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſe in knowledge. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.99. <hi>I have more underſtanding than all my Teachers, for thy Teſtimonies are my meditation.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Turn from your ſins, and then God will pour out his Spirit upon you, and enlighten your minds, and open your underſtandings, that you may underſtand his word. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my reproof, behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</hi> Continuance in ſin darkens the mind, that though a man have means of knowledge, and ſet himſelf to get underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he will be ever learning, and not be able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6, 7. — <hi>Laden with ſins, and led away with divers luſts, ever learning, and never able to

But when we forſake our ſins and turn unto God, he will take away our ignorance, and give us ſaving knowledge. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the World, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of Life.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Converſe with the Servants of Chriſt, that have acquaintance with Chriſt, and they will bring you acquainted with him. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe.</hi> The Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that could ſee no greater excellency in Chriſt than in other things, and wondered that the Spouſe ſhould be ſick of love for him, and give them ſuch a charge concerning him. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. <hi>What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou

                  </p>
                  <p>Second Hinderance. Many men are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt, if they might have Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt in their own way, and upon their own terms, as if they might be exempted from the croſs, if they might have liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their ſins, and the like, but they ſtick at the terms of the Goſpel, on which Chriſt is offered to them. To remove this obſtacle, I ſhall propoſe theſe following conſiderations to thy Soul.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Conſider who thou art, that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtand upon terms with the great God, about thy Salvation. Thou art a condemned creature, a child of wrath, a loſt creature, an undone creature, a ſinner, a miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a poor worm. And ſhall a condemned creature refuſe a pardon unleſs he may have it on his own terms? Shall a child of wrath refuſe reconciliation with God? Shall a loſt periſhing creature refuſe a Saviour, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:105607:126"/>creature refuſe help, a great ſinner refuſe forgiveneſs of his ſins, a miſerable creature refuſe mercy, unleſs he may have it in his own way? Shall a poor worm that is not worthy of the leaſt of all Gods mercies, refuſe Chriſt and all the benefits of Chriſt, becauſe he may not have them on his own terms?</item>
                     <item>2. Conſider what the torments of Hell are, from which Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, they are intolerable and eternal torments. And conſider what the joys of Heaven are, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for us, they are eternal and unſpeakable joys. And ſhall we refuſe to have deliverance from the torments of Hell, unleſs we may have it in our own way, and upon our own terms? Shall we refuſe a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Kingdom of Heaven, unleſs we may have it in our own way, and upon our own terms? Did we underſtand, believe and conſider the reality, and greatneſs, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Hells Torments, and Heaven's Joys, we ſhould be willing to do any thing, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing, ſo we might eſcape the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell, and obtain the Joys of Heaven when we dye. VVhat the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galathians. Gal.</hi> 3.1. <hi>O fooliſh Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth</hi> — The like may I ſay to ſuch as ſtick at receiving Chriſt on the terms of the Goſpel, O fooliſh ſinners, who hath bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, that you ſhould not accept of Chriſt, and Salvation by Chriſt on the terms of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105607:126"/>Goſpel. O fooliſh Sinners, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched you, that you ſhould not accept of Chriſt and Salvation by Chriſt in the terms of the Goſpel. How gladly would the Devils, and the damned in Hell accept of Salvation on the terms of the Goſpel, if it were offered to them; And wilt thou refuſe that which a Devil would joyfully accept, if it were offered to him. How earneſtly did the rich man beg for a drop of water to cool his tongue, when he was tormented in Hell fire; and if he were ſo earneſt for a drop of water to cool his tongue; how readily would he have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced deliverance?</item>
                     <item>3. Conſider what great want you have of Chriſt to juſtifie, ſanctifie, and ſave your Souls. You have greater want of Chriſt, than you have of Food, or Rayment, or any thing in this world. You are in ſuch want of Chriſt, that you are utterly undone to all Eternity without Chriſt. When men are in want, they will comply with hard and difficult terms, to have their wants ſupplyed. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.14, 15, 16. When the Prodigal Son began to be in want, he was willing to ſubmit to a very low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to feed, and look after Swine, and he was willing to fare very hardly, to eat husks, ſuch as were given to Hogs. <hi>He would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the ſwine did eat.</hi> And theſe difficulties he readily complyed with as ſoon as he began to be in want. We have been in want of Chriſt ever
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105607:127"/>ſince we were born, and our want of Chriſt is greater than our want of neceſſary food; for the want of food only deſtroys the Body, but for want of Chriſt, our precious Souls periſh for ever. Why then do we ſtand upon terms with God about accepting Chriſt, that either we muſt have him on our own terms, or elſe we will not have him all. We would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go much hardſhip to get bread for our Bodies. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.9. <hi>We gat our bread with the peril of our lives, becauſe of the ſword of the Wilderneſs.</hi> And ſhall we not be willing to undergo grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter difficulties to get Chriſt the bread of Life.</item>
                     <item>4. If thou wilt not have Chriſt and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt in God's way, and upon God's terms, thou ſhalt never be ſaved by him, for God will not alter the way of Life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſaving of thy Soul. <hi>Job.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Shall the Earth be forſaken for thee? And ſhall the Rock be removed out of his place.</hi> God's Eternal counſels and purpoſes for the ſaving loſt man, are firmer than the Rock, and ſtand faſter than the Earth. And therefore 'tis a vain thing for thee to imagine that God ſhould alter the way of Life and Salvation, decree'd in his eternal counſels, and propoſed in the Goſpel. When they that were invited to the Marriage Supper, refuſed to come; the King was angry, and ſaid, none of them ſhould ſo much as taſte of his Supper. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.24. <hi>I ſay unto you, that none of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper.</hi> And if we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:105607:127"/>refuſe and fall ſhort of Salvation by Chriſt, our caſe will be worſe than the caſe of the Heathens, that never heard of Chriſt, and in ſome reſpects, worſe than the condition of the Devils, that never had an offer of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</item>
                     <item>5.

As Chriſt ſuffered before he entred into Glory. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter into his glory?</hi> So muſt we bear our Croſs, before we wear our Crown.

For if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him. If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> And who would not ſuffer a little while with Chriſt here, upon good aſſurance that he ſhall reign with Chriſt in Heaven for ever. The way to the Kingdom of Heaven lyeth through much tribulation. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.22. <hi>We muſt through much tribulation enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> That man hath very mean thoughts of Heaven, that will go out of the way that leadeth to the Kingdom of Heaven, for avoiding the troubles that are in the way to this Kingdom. All the troubles that we meet with in this preſent life, for the ſake of Chriſt. are not worthy to be compared with the glory we ſhall have in Heaven. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17, 18. <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo glorifyed together.

The rough and narrow and difficult way of ſufferings, is better than the ſmooth, broad, and eaſy way of ſin; For the broad and eaſy, and pleaſant way of ſin leadeth unto deſtruction, it leadeth a man unto the Lake, that burneth with Fire and Brimſtone. And who would be tempted to go in a ſmooth and pleaſant, and broad way, that is ſure as ſoon as he is at the end of his way, he ſhall be caſt into a Furnace of Fire? But the narrow, and difficult, and rough way of the Croſs leadeth, as we heard before, unto the Kingdom of Glory. Beſides, they that walk in the ſmooth way of ſin, though they may have eaſe to the Fleſh, yet they have trouble and pain in their Conſciences. <hi>Job</hi> 15.20. <hi>The wicked man Travelleth with pain all his days.

                  <p n="1">1. VVe ſhall have no need of theſe things when we dye, and therefore we are willing to part with them when we dye, but we ſhall have need of them while we live, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can't tell how to part with them for Chriſt.</p>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:105607:135"/>What Death takes from us, it leaves to our Children, but what we part with for Chriſt, is gone from us, and from our Children for ever; and therefore we can better part with all we have to Death, than to Chriſt. I anſwer,</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Sufferers for Chriſt, that part with all they have for Chriſt, leave their Children a better Inheritance than Houſes, or Lands; they leave them the bleſſing of God.

                  <p n="1">1. That if you will love Life for Chriſt's ſake, you ſhall ſave it, but by ſaving your Life when Chriſt calleth you to lay it down, you ſhall loſe it. <hi>Mark.</hi> 8.35. <hi>For whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it, but whoſoever ſhall loſe his Soul for my ſake and the Goſpels, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi> That is, he that will ſave his Natural Life, and refuſe to lay it down for Chriſt, ſhall loſe Eternal Life, and that will lay down his Natural Life for Chriſt, ſhall have Eternal Life. And it is of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concernment which Chriſt ſpeaketh here: Every man, whoſoever he be that will lay down his Life for Chriſt in this VVorld, that ſame man ſhall have Eternal Life in the other VVorld. And every man, whoſoever he be that will not lay down his Life for Chriſt in this
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:105607:138"/>VVorld, when called to it, that ſame man ſhall loſe Eternal in the other VVorld. And what a good, and what a happy Exchange is this, to exchange a ſhort and temporal Life, for an Eternal Life; a miſerable ſinful Life on Earth, for a glorious Life in Heaven?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we refuſe to lay down our lives for Chriſt vvhen he calls us to it, he can take them avvay from us vvhen he pleaſeth; He can take them by the Svvord, or Peſtilence, or ſome violent ſickneſs, that ſhall make us a terrour to our ſelves, and to all that are round about us. He hath the Keys of Hell, and of Death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. He kills, and ſaves alive whom he pleaſeth. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 31.15. <hi>My times are in thy hands. Job</hi> 12.10. <hi>In whoſe hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</hi> If we were to live for ever in this VVorld, we might have ſome cloak for our ſins, in being unwilling to die for Chriſt. But ſeeing we muſt die within a few days, when Chriſt pleaſeth, and of what Death he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, is it not better dying for Chriſt, than to dye of the Peſtilence, or dye of a Fevour, or any other kind of Death? Is it not inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly for to loſe Eternal Life for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Life here on Earth a few days, when as we know not whither we ſhall onjoy it one day, or one hour after we have refuſed to lay it down for Chriſt: And if vve do enjoy it for ſome time, vve muſt never expect to have any comfort of our Lives after vve have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to die for Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. If we refuſe to lay down our lives for Chriſt, he can make our lives ſuch a burden to us, that we ſhall count it a great mercy to be rid of them. The Lord can lay ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles upon us, that we ſhall be burdens to our ſelves, and long exceedingly to be in our Graves. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of ſome men that are in ſuch miſery, that they ſeek for Death, as for hid Treaſures, and rejoyce exceedingly when God will take away their lives. <hi>Job</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. <hi>Wherefore is light given to him that is in miſery, and life unto the bitter in Soul, which long for Death, but it cometh not, and dig for it, more than for hid treaſures, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce exceedingly, and are glad when they can find a grave.</hi> Yea, it was <hi>Job</hi>'s own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be a burden to himſelf. <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. <hi>Why haſt thou ſet me as a mark againſt thee, ſo as I am a burden to my ſelf.</hi> He vvas in ſo much miſery, that he prayed earneſtly to God that he might die. <hi>Job</hi> 6.8, 9. <hi>O that I might have my requeſt, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for: Even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me, that he would let loſe his hand, and cut me off.</hi> He vvas in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that Life vvas loathſome to him, and if it had been lavvful, he would have ſtrangled himſelf. <hi>Job</hi> 7.15, 16. <hi>My Soul chooſeth ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and death, rather than life. I loath it, I would not live alway.</hi> And vvho can tell, but God may lay as heavy affliction upon us, if vve refuſe to die for Chriſt, as he did to his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:105607:139"/>Servant <hi>Job,</hi> who was an upright man, that feared God, and eſchewed evil? Who can tell, but God may deal with us, as he did with <hi>Paſhur. Jer.</hi> 20.4. <hi>I will make thee a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to thy ſelf, and to all thy Friends.</hi> Now is it not better to die for Chriſt, than to live in ſuch miſery as to be a burden to our ſelves, and to be a terrour to our ſelves, and all our Frinds?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we will not loſe our lives for Chriſt, we ſhall loſe that which is the life of our lives, yea, that which is better than life. What is that which is the life of our lives, and which is better than our lives? I anſwer. The love and favour of God. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 30.5. <hi>In his favour is life. Pſ.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than life.</hi> Now if we draw back from Chriſt in a ſuffering day, becauſe we are not willing to lay down our lives for him, we ſhall loſe the love and favour of God. <hi>Rebeccah</hi> was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for <hi>Jacob,</hi> that if he miſcarried in his match, ſhe thought ſhe ſhould be weary of her life, and her life would do her no good. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.46. <hi>I am weary of my life, becauſe of the Daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a Wife of the Daughters of Heth, ſuch as theſe which are the Daughters of the Land, what good ſhall my life do me?</hi> If the miſcarriage of a Child in a match will make us weary of our lives, what will the loſs of the love and favour of God, which is the fountain of all mercies. May not ſuch ſay, I am weary of my life, what good will my life
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:105607:140"/>do me, ſeeing God hath taken away his lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs from me?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt laid down his life forus. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us.</hi> His Enemies could not have taken his life from him, if he had not been willing of himſelf to lay it down, and his laying down his life was upon our account, and for our ſakes. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15, 18. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep.—No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> And what the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of Chriſt, he is worth ten thouſand of us, yea, more worth than all the men that ever lived, more worth than all the Angels of Heaven, yet he laid down his life for us. And ſhall we that are his Servants, poor worms, ſtick at the laying down our lives for him?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a bleſſed thing to dye for Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord.</hi> The dead which die in the Lord, and which die for the Lord are in a moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition. There is a peculiar honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe that ſuffer Martyrdom, for Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.4.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſome will ſay, I could be willing to dye for Chriſt, ſo I might dye an eaſy death, but I can't tell how to endure ſuch tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and pains, as ſome have met with for Chriſt. I can't tell how to undergo burning
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:105607:140"/>at a Stake, or how to bear tormenting pains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is true that tormenting pains are hard to be born, yet we muſt be willing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go any kind of tortures for Chriſt, not only to dye, but to ſubmit to the moſt painfull death, if God ſhall call us to it, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to be willing to undergo torments for Chriſt; Let us conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Lord Jeſus did not only dye for us, but he ſuffered a moſt painfull, ſhamefull, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Death of the Croſs for us. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> What Death is more painfull than the Death of the Croſs? Our Lord Jeſus was in ſuch extremity of pain when he hung upon the Croſs, that he was like a man that had all his Bones out of joynt, his heart melted like wax that is brought to the fire, his ſtrength and the moiſture of his body, was dryed up like a Potſheard, his tongue cleaved to his Jaws, as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14, 15. <hi>I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joynt, my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels, My ſtrength is dryed up like a potſheard, and my tongue cleaveth unto my jaws, and thou hast brought me into the duſt of death.</hi> That this relates to Chriſts ſufferings on the Croſs, is evident from the laſt clauſe, his bones were out of joynt, his heart melted like wax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when? when he was upon the Croſs; <hi>Thou
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:105607:141"/>haſt brought me into the duſt of Death.</hi> And from ſeveral other paſſages in the Pſalm, which relate to Chriſts ſufferings on the Croſs. As <hi>ver.</hi> 1.7, 8, 16, 17. And beſides that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh which our Lord Jeſus felt upon the Croſs, when he was in the Garden, he was in ſuch an agony as made him ſweat drops of blood. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.24. Now ſeeing our Lord Jeſus Chriſt endured ſuch torments and pains for us, ſeeing he ſuffered the painfull, ſhamefull, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Death of the Croſs for us; Shall not we be willing to ſuffer any ſhamefull or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Death for him? Seeing he bore the wrath of God for us, ſhall not we be willing to bear the wrath of our Perſecutors for his ſake.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we refuſe a painfull and tormenting Death for Chriſt, God can inflict worſe pains upon us for our ſins, than men can inflict upon us for our fidelity to Chriſt. For

                  <p n="5">5. If we will forſake our ſins, the Lord will ſave us from the torments of Hell for ever, and give to us his Heavenly Kingdom. <hi>Job.</hi> 33, 27, 28. <hi>He looked upon me, and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not, He will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Soul from going down into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light,</hi> What is there in ſin, that we ſhould refuſe all theſe great things, rather than leave our ſins?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that Sin is the greateſt evil in the world, that there is nothing doth us ſo much miſchief, and is ſo prejudicial to our wellfare as ſin is, and that may make us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forſake our ſins. See what an evil thing ſin is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sin is worſe than any affliction, as the Sword, Peſtilence, Famine, Poverty, noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſeaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For neither Sword, nor Famine, or any other affliction can ſeparate us from the love of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. But ſin makes us hateful to, and hated of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of Iniquity.</hi> No affliction can hinder our Salvation. <hi>Lazarus</hi>
                     <pb n="276" facs="tcp:105607:146"/>was exceeding poor, he begged his bread, and was full of noyſom ſores, yet his Soul was carryed by the Angel into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, but ſin will hinder the Salvation of our Souls. Now we flee from the Sword and Peſtilence, and other Judgments, and ſhall we not much more flee from ſin, which is a greater evil than all theſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is a greater evil than Hell it ſelf; for God made Hell, but ſin is the work of the Devil. And therefore ſin, which is the work of the Devil, muſt needs be worſe than Hell, which is the work of God. Hell ſets forth the glory of Gods Juſtice, but ſin wholly diſhonours God, and therefore ſin is worſe than Hell. Now we are very deſirous to be delivered from Hell, and why ſhall we not be willing to leave our ſins which are worſe than Hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is nothing in the world doth us ſo much hurt and miſchief, as ſin doth. Sin ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates us from God the chiefeſt good. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. What poyſon is to the body, that ſin is to the Soul, the Souls poyſon. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13. <hi>The poyſon of aſps is under their lips.</hi> Sin wars againſt our Souls. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. And will be the Death of our Souls, if we do not forſake it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> We flee from Death, and thoſe things that bring Death. VVhen there was a deadly herb in the pottage, the Sons of the Prophets would not eat thereof, but cryed out, <hi>O thou man of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:105607:146"/>God, there is death in the pot, and they would not eat thereof.</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.40. I may ſay the like to impenitent ſinners, O thou ſinner, there is Death in thy ſins, O thou Drunkard, there is Death in thy Cup, O thou Unclean Perſon, there is Death in the Harlots houſe, and to the unrighteous man, there is Death in thy falſe weights, and falſe meaſures, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful-balances. And ſhall not this make us willing to leave our ſins, that there is Death in our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If no conſideration will encline your hearts to a willingneſs to forſake your ſins, look up to Chriſt that he would put forth his grace, and divine power upon your Souls, to make you willing to forſake your ſins, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſerve and obey him. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be a willing people in the day of thy power.</hi>

                  <p n="5">5. See what it is which makes you ſo unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave your ſins, and get thoſe cords cut in ſunder, whereby your wills and affections are hold intangled in your ſins. VVhen men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to leave their ſins, it is uſually from one of theſe two cauſes, either from the delight and pleaſures they have in their ſins, or from the gain, and profit they have by them.

                  <p>A 4th. hinderance to our cloſing with Chriſt is unwillingneſs to come under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and yield obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel, eſpecially ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as are croſs to our intereſt, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our corrupt natures, and in ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as are like the pulling out of right eyes, and cutting off Right hands; In ſuch caſes, and in reference to ſuch commands; Many are ready to ſay, this is an hard ſaying, who can bear it? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.60. And ſay in their hearts, <hi>We will not have this man to Reign over us. Luk.</hi> 19.15. Now to remove this ſtumbling block, I ſhall propoſe ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade us to be willing to receive Chriſt for our Lord, and to obey him in the moſt difficult duties that he requireth of us, even ſuch as are like the cutting off a right hand, and pulling out a right eye.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus commands us to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, requireth nothing of us, but what is for our own good. <hi>Mich</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> The

It ſeems a very hard matter to cut off our Right Hand or our Foot, or to pluck out a Right Eye, when any of theſe Members cauſe us to offend: yet it is really better for us to remove the impediments of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though as dear as our Eyes, as uſefull and beneficial to us as our Hands and Feet, and to enter into Life, blind, and halt, and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than to reſerve the occaſions of offence and ſtumbling, and to be caſt into Hell Fire. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43. to the 48. ver.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Another hindrance of our receiving and accepting Chriſt, is, when there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other that lyeth nearer our heart than Chriſt, which we love, and prefer above Chriſt, and are not willing to part with for Chriſt. Now to ſuch I would ſay theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You can have no part in Chriſt, unleſs you love and prefer him above all things in the world, and be willing to forſake all things for him. <hi>Math.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me, and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Our Parents, and our Children may and ought to be loved, but not more than Chriſt, for if we love the deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have in the world more than Chriſt, we ſhall not be partakers of Chriſt. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.33. <hi>Whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> For if a man love any things, or perſons more than Chriſt, when thoſe things or perſons come in competition with Chriſt, he will forſake Chriſt, rather than thoſe things or perſons which he loves above Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A man may go far in the profeſſion and practice of Religious duties, and may prefer
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:105607:153"/>Chriſt above many things, and yet may have ſome one thingly nearer his heart than Chriſt, and rather than part with that one thing, he may chuſe to part with Jeſus Chriſt. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this we have in the young man that came to Chriſt to enquire how he might obtain Eternal Life. He ſpoke reſpectfully, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and underſtandingly to Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may have Eternal Life?</hi> He ſhewed his reſpect to Chriſt, in calling him Maſter, his affection in calling him good Maſter, his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in that he came to Chriſt about the weightieſt matter in the whole world, Eternal Life; and his good inclinations, that he deſired to know what good thing he ſhould do to have Eternal Life. Moreover he had from his youth up addicted himſelf to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Commandments of God. <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my youth up.</hi> Yet this young man had one thing that lay nearer his heart than Chriſt, and that was the love of the world. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.21. <hi>One thing thou lackeſt, go ſell whatſoever thou haſt.</hi> And when Chriſt put him on the Tryal, he choſe rather to part with Chriſt, than with his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, though it was ſome grief to him to part with Chriſt, yet he went away from him rather than he would part with his poſſeſſions. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.22. <hi>When the young man heard that ſaying, he went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:105607:153"/>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no perſon, nothing in the whole world that deſerves ſo much of our love as Chriſt. It is moſt equitable and reaſonable that we ſhould love Chriſt above our deareſt Relations, above all things and perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever On ſeveral accounts. I will name two, or three.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) None ever ſhewed ſuch love to us, as Chriſt hath done. The love of Father and Mother, and the deareſt Friends we have in all the world, is ſhort of the love of Chriſt. The The greateſt love that man can ſhew, is to die for his Friend. <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his Friends.</hi> This love Chriſt hath ſhewn to us, he layd down his life for us; yea, greater than this, for he did not lay his Life for us when we were Friends, but when we were Enemies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> All earthly ſimilitudes, as the love of an Huband to his Wife, the love of Parents to their Children, the love of a man to his Friend are too ſhort to ſet out Chriſt's love to us, and therefore he fetcheth a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon from Heaven, and likens his love to us, as his Fathers love to him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9. <hi>As the Father hath loved me, ſo have I loved you.</hi> As Chriſt's love is greater to us than the love of any man in the world, ſo it is of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. Our Parents love was not towards us till we had our beings, and ceaſeth when
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:105607:154"/>we go to our Grave, for though there be grief and ſorrow for a ſeaſon at our Death, yet in proceſs of time, dead men are forgotten both by them that loved, and hated, and envied them. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.5, 6. <hi>The memory of them is forgotten. Alſo their love, and their hatred, and their envy is now periſhed.</hi> But Chriſt's love to us is Everlaſting. It was towards us before we had our beings, even from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and will be towards us, when we ſhall ceaſe to be in this world even unto Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love.</hi> Now Chriſt having loved us more than any man ever loved us, it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we ſhould love him above all.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Jeſus Chriſt is more amiable than any other perſons or things in the World. <hi>He is altogether lovely. Cant.</hi> 5.16. This can't be ſaid of any Creatures ſince the fall of man, that they are altogether lovely, for there is ſomething of unlovelineſs in them. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver there is in any Creatures that may attract our love, it is eminently and tranſcendently in Chriſt. As for Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>Is our love drawn by others love to us? Love will beget love in all ſorts of men. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Sinners love thoſe that love them.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any man ſhewed ſuch love to us, as Chriſt hath done, as proved before. Doth beauty draw our love, it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Thou art fairer than the Children of men. Pſ.</hi> 45.2. There are all excellencies and perfections to be found
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105607:154"/>in Chriſt. Is our love drawn by beneficence and bounty? Thus doth great things with moſt men. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.5. <hi>Every man is a Friend to him that giveth gifts.</hi> None ever gave us ſuch gifts as Chriſt hath given to us, none hath been ſo bountiful and beneficial to us, as Chriſt Jeſus. Is it propriety that ingageth our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? A man loveth his own Children above other Children, and his own things above other things. <hi>John</hi> 15.19. <hi>The World loves his own.</hi> There is nothing ſo much our own in this VVorld, as Chriſt is, if we be true Chriſtians. He is our own Lord, and our own Maſter, he hath given himſelf for us, and given himſelf to us; He is ours by an Everlaſting Covenant, we are united to him, he is our Head, and we are Members of his body, and he dwelleth in us by his Spirit. And we are more his, than we are our own, or any other mans. He made us, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, and bought us with a price, and hath betrothed us to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) We are under greater Obligations and Ingagements to love Chriſt, than we are to love our Parents, or any other Relations, or deareſt Friends in the world. For none ever did, or ſuffered ſuch great things for us, of Chriſt hath done. He hath reconciled us to God, He hath obtained for us the pardon of all our ſins, he hath ſaved us from the torments as Hell, he hath purchaſed an Everlaſting for our Inheritance in the other VVorld, he
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:105607:155"/>hath made us Kings and Prieſts to our God, He appeareth in the preſence of God for us, and is continually making interceſſion for us: The benefits we have by Chriſt are innumerable. It is ſaid of <hi>David.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.16. <hi>All Iſrael and Judah loved David, becauſe he went out, and came in before them.</hi> Chriſt the Son of <hi>David</hi> doth more than this for us, he ſticks cloſer to us than <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee. How ought we then to love Chriſt for this, and not only for this, but all the benefits we have by him. which are far greater than we have by any man in the the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is moſt equitable and reaſonable that we ſhould in all things give Chriſt the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, and prefer him above, and before all things in the world, and that on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>(1.) It is the will and good pleaſure of God, the Father, that his Son Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be preferred by us above all things in the world, and therefore he hath made him head of the Church. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>And he is the head of the Body, the Church, that in all things he might have the preeminence.</hi>

But if they be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, if they do not flee away in the time of life, it is moſt certain, we muſt leave them all behind us when we dye. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. <hi>For we brought nothing into the World, and it is certain that we can carry nothing out.</hi> But if we embrace Chriſt, Chriſt and his benefits ſhall be ours for ever. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever.

If Chriſt be not accepted before we dye, then we ſhall miſs of him for ever. The day of grace, and the day of Salvation is gone for ever, if Chriſt be not embraced before Death comes. But as long as we are in the land of the living, there is a door of hope ſtands open to us. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.5. <hi>To him that is joyned to all the living, there is hope.</hi> As long as we are under the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, which is the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, it is an accepted time, and a day of Salvation. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Compared with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God — Behold now is the accepted
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:105607:175"/>time, behold now is the Day of Salvation.</hi> While God is treating with us by his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, who do in Chriſt's ſtead pray us to be reconciled to God, ſo long 'tis an accepted time, and a day of Salvation. Upon the laſt day of the Feaſt, when the people were to be diſmiſſed, and ſent to their own home, the Lord Jeſus made an offer of himſelf to all that did thirſt after him. <hi>Joh</hi> 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying, if any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> This Feaſt was the Feaſt of Tabernacles, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. which Feaſt laſted many days. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.34, 36. Their dwelling in Tabernacles while in the VVilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till they came to <hi>Canaan,</hi> was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of our Frailty, whilſt we remain in the Body, which is called a Tabernacle. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>I muſt put of this my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> that is, my body; As our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus offered himſelf to every one that was a thirſt on the laſt day of the Feaſt of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, ſo he doth offer himſelf to us, even to the laſt day of our continuance in our Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe of this Tabernacle. The penitent thief who embraced Chriſt, the laſt day of his being in this Earthly Tabernacle, upon the day of his death, was accepted of him.</p>
                  <p>But ſome may ſay again, the weary, and the thirſty, and the heavy laden, and ſuch as are of a broken heart, and are burdened with their ſins, are invited to come to Chriſt, but
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:105607:176"/>I am not affected as I ought to be, with my ſin and miſery, I am not humbled for my ſins, but I have an hard, dead, inſenſible heart, and therefore I am afraid Chriſt is not offered to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. Even ſuch as are not affected with their ſin and miſery, but have high thoughts of their own excellencies, when as in truth they are wretched and miſerable, are invited to come to Chriſt for good and white ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and eye Salve, whereby they may have a true ſight of their own ſtate, and be made ſenſible of their ſin and miſery. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Becauſe thou ſayeſt I am rich, and encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with goods, and have need of nothing, and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked— I counſel thee to buy of me Gold and white Rayment— and anoint thine eyes with eye ſalve, that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſee</hi>— VVe ſee the pooreſt and moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which are not affected as they ought with their ſin and miſery, are called upon to repair to Chriſt, and to be dealing with Chriſt, for the choiceſt of his benefits, Gold, white Rayment, eye ſalve, that they might ſee, and be made rich, and have their nakedneſs covered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Chriſt was ſent to bind up, and heal the broken in heart; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. So he was exalted to give Repentance to hard hearted ſinners. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. And it is his work to
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:105607:176"/>take away the ſtony heart from thoſe that have ſtony hearts, and give them hearts of fleſh; For it is the Lords promiſe to take away the ſtony heart, and to give an heart of fleſh. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. And it belongs to Chriſt, as he is Mediator and ſurety of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to ſee this as well as other promiſes of the Covenant fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sleepy and ſecure ſinners are called upon by the Goſpel, to awake out of their ſleep, and to look to Chriſt for light and life. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, awake thou that ſleepest, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though you do not find ſuch an hunger and thirſt, ſuch a wearineſs and burdened condition as others find, yet if you are willing to have Chriſt on the terms of the Goſpel, willing to be ruled and ſaved by him in his own way, you need not doubt but Chriſt with all his ſaving benefits is offered freely to you, as freely as to any other perſon, for he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freely to every one whoſoever he be, that is willing to have him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi>

               <p>I Have ſhewed how ſuch as have an intereſt in Chriſt, may find comfort in Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all perſonal and national troubles, and under the perſecutions of the Church, I ſhall now ſhew that there is comfort to be had in Chriſt, under all Spiritual troubles. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Stay me with flaggons, comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of love.</hi> This being ſick of love ſignifieth foul troubles, and where doth the ſpouſe ſeek for comfort under foul troubles, but from Chriſt and the benefits we have by Chriſt. <hi>Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples</hi>— By flagons we are to underſtand wine, which was wont to be diſtributed in flagons. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. <hi>He dealt among all the people a cake of bread, and a flagon of wine.</hi> Now the benefits that we have by the death of Chriſt, are compared to wine which makes glad the heart of man, and are called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the name of wine. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters— yea come buy wine</hi>— Wine was appointed by Chriſt, to be the repreſentation and memorial
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:105607:178"/>of his blood, and the benefits purchaſed by his blood, namely remiſſion of ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the new Covenant. Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wine which is drunk at his Table, ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament. which is ſhed for many, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. <hi>This cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood.</hi> Under the law there was Wine offered with the dayly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, every Morning and Evening. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38, 40. Now Wine being that which makes glad the heart of man. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15. VVe may learn hence, that all thoſe comforts which make glad the heart of man, they are the fruit and effect of Chriſts being made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for us. <hi>Stay me with flaggons,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſupport with thoſe comforts and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood, ſtay me with the diſcovery of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of my ſins, and the promiſes of the New Covenant. <hi>Comfort me with Apples</hi>— what are theſe Apples? The fruits and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits we have by Chriſts death, who bore our ſins in his own body upon the Tree. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. In the foregoing verſe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is likened to an Apple-tree; <hi>As the Apple-tree among the trees of the Wood, ſo is my beloved among the ſons, I ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſt.</hi> Now the benefits which we have by the incarnation, the Death and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt, are the Fruit growing on
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:105607:179"/>this Apple tree, which was ſweet to the Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes taſt, and are the Apples with which ſhe deſired to be comforted, when ſhe was ſick of love.</p>
               <p>That we are to ſeek our comfort in Chriſt and from Chriſt, under all Soul troubles, we may ſee from ſeveral other Scriptures. As, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, for the help of his countenance.</hi> Countenance ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth favour, becauſe a mans favour is diſcerned by a chearfull Countenance. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.15. God's favour is towards us in Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. So that we ſee whence the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his Conſolations, when his Soul was in a perplexed, diſquieted condition, it was from the help of God's Countenance, that is, from that relief and ſupport which he ſhould find from the manifeſtation of Gods love in Chriſt to his Soul. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.2. <hi>From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the Rock that is higher than I.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus in Scripture is reſembled to a Rock. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>That Rock was Chriſt.</hi> VVhen <hi>David</hi>'s heart was overwhelmed with grief, and when he was in deſolate places, where he had none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, he begs to be led to Chriſt, who was the Rock that was higher than he, for he knew there was ſupport and comfort in Chriſt, under the greateſt inward troubles, though
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:105607:179"/>ſuch as overwhelmed the heart, as appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 2. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I— ſo will I ſing praiſe unto thy name for ever.</hi> VVhen <hi>David</hi> was in great heavineſs through the hidings of Gods face, and walked day by day with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull heart, he found joy and comfort in Chriſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, (O Lord) for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long ſhall I take counſell in my Soul, having ſorrow in my heart dayly? — My heart ſhall rejoyce in thy Salvation.</hi> By thy Salvation here we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is called the Salvation of God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation;</hi> That is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. See alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>That thou mayeſt be my Salvation unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> By thy Salvation we may alſo underſtand that Temporal and Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he hoped that God for Chriſt's ſake would beſtow upon him; So that it was from Chriſt, and the benefits which come by Chriſt, that <hi>David</hi> fetched his comfort in all his Soul troubles; And therefore all of us that are under any ſoul troubles, ſhould repair to Chriſt for comfort. It is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.2. <hi>Every one that was in diſtreſs, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was diſcontent</hi> (or as it is in the Margent) <hi>bitter of Soul, gathered themſelves unto him, and he became a Captain over them.</hi> Let us do

                  <p>In Regenerate perſons there are remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Original Corruption.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:105607:180"/>remainders of Original Corruption.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt's blood is a Fountain ſet open on purpoſe for waſhing away the Fountain of ſin, and uncleanneſs that is in, and iſſueth forth out of our hearts. <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>In that day, there ſhall be a Fountain opened to the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin, and for uncleanneſs.</hi> This Fountain is the blood of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son, cleanſeth from all ſins.</hi> There is no other Fountain under Heaven ſet open for the cleanſing away of ſin, but the blood of Chriſt, which is compared to a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe of its ſufficiency to ſupply all commers, and the continual efficacy, the Fountain runs night and day continually. The day wherein this Fountain is ſet open, is the day and time of the Goſpel; For under the law it was covered over with divers Types and Ceremonies, it was vailed with the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but now that vail, that covering is done away. It was a Fountain ſealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but now 'tis a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain opened to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for though only the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are named, yet the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are included in this promiſe, for they are of the ſame body, and fellow-heirs with the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the promiſes of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. Obſerve farther, for what end this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is ſet open, that is, <hi>for ſin and for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,</hi> that is, to waſh away all ſorts, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:105607:181"/>all manner of ſins, our Original and Actual ſins, the uncleanneſs of our hearts and lives. It may amaze us when we ſee and conſider what a Fountain of ſin and uncleanneſs is in our hearts, but it may greatly comfort us, when we conſider that Chriſt's blood is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſet open on purpoſe to waſh away ſin and uncleanneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though ſin doth, and will dwell in us as long as we live, yet this may comfort us, it ſhall not have the dominion over us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, becauſe ye are not under the Law but under Grace.</hi> For our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath by his death obtained deliverance from the reigning power of indwelling corruption, ſo that though ſin remain in us, it ſhall not reign over us, we ſhall not be the ſervants of ſin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is Cruciſied with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> And therefore though we find ſin not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dwelling in us, but warring againſt the law of our minds, and ſometimes prevailing over us, and leading us captive, yet we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God for Chriſt's ſake, will both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſubdue our ſins. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3. <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties prevail againſt me, as for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thou ſhalt purge them away.</hi> The purging away of ſin implyes both the pardoning our ſins by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. and the mortification of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:105607:181"/>ſin, or purging ſin out of our hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. and 27.9. Now <hi>David</hi> did reſt upon God for the purging away his Tranſgreſſions, even when he found iniquities prevailing, that is, he did truſt in God, that for Chriſt's ſake he would both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſubdue his ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As it is a ground of trouble that ſin dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us, ſo it is a ground of great comfort that we have the Spirit of Chriſt to dwell in us as a Fountain of grace and holineſs, and that this Spirit of grace ſhall dwell in us for ever, and as a Well of water, ſpringing up to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> And this Spirit of Chriſt which is given to us, to dwell in our hearts, ſhall dwell and abide with us for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, he dwelleth in you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> And he dwelleth in us as a Fountain of Grace and Holineſs, or as a VVell of water ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Everlaſting Life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>The water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of water, ſpringing up into Everlaſting Life.</hi>
                  </p>

I will inſtance in ſome grounds of Conſolation for weak Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a ſufficiency of Grace and Strength in Chriſt, for the weak as well as the ſtrong. What was ſaid to the Apoſtle, when he was under the buffetings of Satan; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid to the weakeſt Chriſtian, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with many fears, and ſtrong temptations, Chriſt's grace is ſufficient for thee, and his
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:105607:185"/>ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs, that is, the weaker we are, the more eminently his ſtrength is put forth, and manifeſted on our behalf. The Lord is wont in an eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to put forth his power in ſupporting and upholding weak Chriſtians. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.29. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he encreaſeth ſtrength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is very tender and carefull of weak and feeble Chriſtians; He gathereth his Lambs with his Arm, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth them in his Boſom. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock like a Shepherd, he ſhall gather the Lambs with his Arm, and carry them in his Boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> By Lambs we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand young and weak Chriſtians. There is no Shepherd ſo tender and carefull of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Lambs, as the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is of his Lambs. His gathering his Lambs with his Arm, ſignifieth his preſerving them by his Divine power, his carrying them in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, ſignifieth his tender love to them, and his tender care over them. They lye near his heart, he carryeth them in his Boſom, he gently leadeth thoſe that are with young, that is, ſuch as are in a burdened condition, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſtreſſed Conſciences.

The Reed is very weak, a little blaſt of wind makes the Reed to ſhake and tremble. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.7. <hi>A Reed ſhaken with the Wind.</hi> The Reed when bruiſed, is weaker than the Reed that is whole. The Reed ſignifieth the weak trembling Chriſtian, the bruiſed Reed a weak Chriſtian bruiſed with afflictions and temptations, ſuch an one Chriſt will not break, that is, he will ſupport and uphold them; <hi>The ſmoking or dimly burning flax, he will not quench;</hi> That is, he will cheriſh weak, and recover lapſed Chriſtians; The wick of the lamp that burns but dimly, that hath much ſmoke obſcuring the light, that hath that which is offenſive (for ſmoke is offenſive to the eyes) mixed with that little light, that little good which is in them, ſuch Chriſt will not quench, but will cheriſh and carry on his own in them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.18. <hi>The eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity, and out of darkneſs.</hi> Though there be much obſcurity and darkneſs mixed with our knowledge, when the Lord firſt opens our eyes, yet by degrees that dimneſs ſhall wear off, and we ſhall have a more clear knowledge of the myſteries of our Salvation. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.3. <hi>The eyes of them that ſee, ſhall not be dim.</hi>

The Corn lyeth buried under ground for a while, and ſeems to be loſt; And after it appears, it meets with cold winds, and froſt, and draught, that makes it hang the head, turn yellow, look in a decaying manner, yet through the warm Sun and Dew of Heaven, it reviveth again; So 'tis with them that dwell under Chriſt's ſhadow, though they meet with many Pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs, and that which was ſpringing up, ſeems to wither and decline, yet they ſhall revive as the Corn, and grow as the Vine. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and cutting the Vine makes the Vine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more fruitfull, and ſo it intimates a growth under afflictions. In the Winter the Vine looks like a dead ſtick, hath no Beauty nor Savour in it, but in the Spring it puts forth and flouriſheth abundantly.

I might mention more promiſes of growth in Grace; As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.12. <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. Now by virtue of theſe and ſuch like promiſes, when we find a decay of Grace, we may reſt upon God that he will come in with freſh ſupplies of Grace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.10. <hi>I ſhall be anointed with freſh Oyl.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:105607:190"/>David</hi> was ſometimes ſenſible of great decays in Spiritual Eſtate, as when he complains <hi>my moiſture is turned into the drought of Summer,</hi> yet then he did reſt upon God for freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Grace and Comfort, which may be the meaning of thoſe words, <hi>I ſhall be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with freſh Oyl:</hi> For the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are called an unction or an anointing. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.20, 29. <hi>Ye have an unction from the Holy one— The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you.</hi> The Graces and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Spirit are compared to Oyl. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Thy God hath anointed thee with the Oyl of gladneſs.

                  <p>Spiritual deadneſs is a great trouble to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls, when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> felt the body of Death, it made him bemoan his wretched condition, that he ſhould be under ſo much deadnſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:105607:192"/>body of this death?</hi> That our comforter againſt ſpiritual deadneſs is in Chriſt, the following words ſhew, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Though there be cauſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we look into our own dead hearts, yet there is cauſe of thanksgiving and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing when we look up to God in Chriſt; And that on theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The end of Chriſts aſſuming our nature and ſuffering death for our ſins, was to give us life, not only eternal life hereafter, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life here, and that in a plentifull meaſure. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they may have it more abundantly. Joh.</hi> 6.51. <hi>I am the living bread which came down from Heaven, if any man eat of this bread he ſhall live for ever, and the bread that I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though there be in us much deadneſs, yet in Chriſt and with Chriſt there is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>For with thee is the fountain of life, and in thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> As it is with Fountains of water, there is water to be had at all times, and for all comers, in the Fountain; So it is with the Fountain of life, there is life to be had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanly, freely, a ſufficiency of life for all comers, at all times to be had from this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord hath given us many gracious and comfortable promiſes to encourage us to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:105607:193"/>hope in him for quickning grace, at ſuch times as we find our ſelves under deadneſs, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet he ſhall live. Joh.</hi> 6.57. <hi>He that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me. Pſal.</hi> 69.32. <hi>Your heart ſhall live that ſeek God.

                  <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt hath provided us excellent helps againſt our deadneſs. I will inſtance in two helps.

We may ſay of the promiſes with <hi>Hezekiah. Iſa.</hi> 38.16. <hi>O Lord by theſe things men live, and in all theſe things is the life of my Spirit.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>(2.) His ſpirit is an excellent help againſt deadneſs. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> The ſpirit of Chriſt is the ſpirit of life, and this quickning ſpirit ſhall be given to thoſe that ask it of God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13.</item>

                     <hi>Sect. 7.</hi> There is comfort in Chriſt for ſuch as are troubled for the weakneſs and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their ſervices.</head>
                  <p>Many Chriſtians finding their ſervice they do for God and their Generations, attended with very great weakneſs, and many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are much troubled and diſcouraged thereby; But to ſuch as go under this burden, there is comfort to be had in Chriſt; and that in theſe reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our perſons and ſervices are accepted of God, not for the worthyneſs that is either in our perſons or ſervices, but for the ſake and upon the account of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> And as our perſons are accepted in Chriſt, ſo are our ſervices alſo. 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.5. — To offer up ſpiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt. If any ſay, how can imperfect ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that have ſin mixed with them be accepted of God; I anſwer, by the merits of Chriſt the imperfections and ſins that are mingled with thoſe holy ſervices which we perform to God are done away, and the ſervices rendered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. <hi>And it ſhall be upon Aarons Forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things of the children of Iſrael, which the children of Iſrael ſhall hollow in all their holy gifts, and it ſhall be alwayes on his Forehead, that they may be accepted before
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105607:194"/>the Lord. Aaron</hi> was a Type of Chriſt our great High Prieſt. The Plate on his Forehead that had graven on it <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> was a Type of the merits of Chriſt, who is the Lord our Righteouſneſs; As <hi>Aaron</hi> bare away the iniquities of the holy things Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, which being done, they were accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God. So Chriſt doth really and truly bear away the ſins of all ſervices, and thereby they are accepted of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though our ſervices have much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and many imperfections in them, yet if they be performed with Upright hearts God will accept them. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.17. <hi>I know alſo my God, that thou tryeſt the heart, and haſt pleaſure in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs.</hi> As little done by an Upright man is more acceptable to God, than great ſervices done by wicked men. <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.8. <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord, but the Prayer of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is his delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. VVould you ſerve God and your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in a better manner if you were able? and is it your burden that you can ſerve God no better? then know for your comfort that God through Chriſt will accept of your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, though you have not ſuch abilities to ſerve him as others have, or as you your ſelves deſire to have. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>If there he firſt a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It is a great comfort to thoſe that mourn over their imperfections, that how imperfect ſoever they are in themſelves, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Ye are compleat in him.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <item>1.

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:105607:195"/>from us, by the blood of Chriſt we are made nigh to God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi>

                     <hi>Sect. 9.</hi> There is comfort in Chriſt for ſuch as are troubled with fears of falling away.</head>
                  <p>What <hi>David</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. <hi>I ſhall now one day periſh by the hand of Saul.</hi> the like ſome Chriſtians who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Chriſt on the terms of the Goſpel, and have given themſelves to Chriſt, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:105607:196"/>to ſay in their hearts, I ſhall one day fall away from Chriſt, and periſh for ever. My heart is ſo treacherous, and indwelling cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſo ſtrong, and Satan's Temptations ſo prevalent, and the oppoſitions from the world may be ſo great that I fear I ſhall not hold out to the end, but ſhall fall away, and this is a great trouble to me. Now there is comfort to be had from Chriſt againſt theſe fears of falling away, and that on theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The interceſſion of Chriſt is a ground of comfort to ſuch Believers on Chriſt as are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with fears of fallingaway; For he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us that our Faith may not fail. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as Wheat; But I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not.</hi> And he that prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> that his Faith might not fail, he hath prayed for all that do and ſhall believe in him. <hi>Joh,</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone. but for them alſo that ſhall believe on me through their word, that they all may be one.</hi> &amp;c. And what Chriſt prayed for was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes granted. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.41, 42. <hi>Father I thank thee that thou haſt heard me, and I know that thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Members of Chriſt may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted againſt their fears of falling away from God's Everlaſting Covenant; For God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into an Everlaſting Covenant with them, that he will not turn away from them, and
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:105607:197"/>that he will keep them from departing from him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>And I will make an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good, and I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The unchangeableneſs of Gods love is a good ground of comfort againſt fears of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Jeſus having loved his own that were in the World, loved them unto the end.</hi> It is not ſaid, having loved his own that are in glory, but that are in the world, where they are liable to temptations and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and troubles, he loved them to the end. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>For I am perſwaded that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death nor life, nor angels, nor principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heigth, nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> God's love being unchangeable, we may reſt ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ſame love which called us to the knowledge and Faith of Chriſt, will keep us from departing from Chriſt, ſeeing the gifts and the callings of God are without Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The ſame love that quickned us when we were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, will alſo preſerve us unto Eternal Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The attributes of God may comfort weak Chriſtians againſt their fears of falling away. The name of the Lord is our ſtrong Tower, whether we may run and be ſafe
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:105607:197"/>againſt theſe fears; as for inſtance

The power of God that is engaged to keep and preſerve us till we are brought ſafe to Heaven. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</hi> And though the Lord lets us fall for our Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, yet he will not ſuffer us to be utterly caſt down. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.23, 24.

                        <item>(2.)

                     <hi>Sect. 10.</hi> There is comfort in Chriſt for ſuch whoſe heart is ſick becauſe there hope is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Hope deferred makes the heart ſick, Prov.</hi> 13.12. And many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans find it true by experience, while hope for promiſed mercies, and mercies begged in prayer, and their hope is deferred, their hearts grow ſick, and their ſpirits faint within them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.7. <hi>Hear me ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly O Lord, my ſpirit faileth, Pſal.</hi> 119.81, 82. <hi>My ſoul fainteth for thy ſalvation. Mine eyes fail for thy word,</hi> ſaying, <hi>when wilt thou comfort me.</hi> Now there is comfort in Chriſt for ſuch as find their hearts fainting, when prayed for, promiſed, hoped for mercies are deferred. And that on theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Promiſed mercies ſhall furely be given in God's time, which is the beſt time for all things, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. — <hi>The viſion</hi> (that is, the mercies promiſed to the prophet in a viſion) <hi>is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lye, though it tarry, wait for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi> And the like I may ſay of mercies begged in prayer, they ſhall furely come if they be ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt intercedeth with his Father to give us all promiſed mercies. For he is the Mediator of the New Covenant,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:105607:199"/>and Mediates with God on our behalf, that for his ſake he would give us all the bleſſings promiſed in the new Covenant. He alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedeth for us with his Father to give us all thoſe mercies which we ask in his name agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. And the Lord will not deny Chriſt any thing for which he maketh interceſſion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The longer hoped for mercies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, the ſweeter they will be when they are given to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Hope deferred maketh the heart ſick, but when the deſire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it is a tree of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. When hoped for mercies are delayed till the heart is ſick, and begins to faint, yet it is good ſtill to keep up our hope in God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18, 26. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.81. For we pleaſe God when we hope in his mercy, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 147.11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The main and beſt of hope is for things laid up in heaven for us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5. <hi>For the hope which is laid up in heaven for you.</hi> If in this life only we had hope in Chriſt, we were of all men moſt miſerable. The beſt bleſſing which a Chriſtian hopes for are laid up in heaven. There we ſhall have an anſwer of all our prayers, a fulfilling of all promiſes, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all our deſires, when that bleſſed hope is accompliſhed, it will make amends for the deferring and fruſtration of all other hopes. Wherefore let us look after and wait patiently for that hope, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. 1 Pet. 1.13.</p>

                  <p>Some Chriſtians are aſſaulted with grievous temptations, as blaſphemous thoughts, ſelf-murder, &amp;c. that they are even weary of their lives. Now to ſuch there is comfort to be had in Chriſt, in ſeveral reſpects, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. None of all the temptations of Satan can bereave a Chriſtian of eternal life. For a Chriſtian's life is hid with Chriſt in God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> And what is hid with Chriſt in God is out of the devils reach.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though Satan may temptthe members of Chriſt, yet he ſhall be never able to overcome them, but they ſhall overcome him and all his temptations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. <hi>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,</hi> Eph. 6.16. <hi>Above all things taking the ſhield of faith, whereby ye ſhall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked. Col.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The worſt of Temptations are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Fatherly love of God. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who was the beloved Son of God was tempted to caſt himſelf down from a pinacle of the Temple, and to fall down and worſhip the devil, and what worſe ſin than to worſhip the devil?</p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:105607:200"/>
                  <p n="4">4. We are aſſured by God, that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the devil he will flee from us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. And therefore whatſoever Temptation he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults us withal, let us reſiſt him, believing that he will flee, and if he come again let us reſiſt him again. We are alſo aſſured, that though the Lord ſuffer Satan to tempt us, yet he will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what he will enable us to bear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man: But God is faithfull who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able: but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi>
